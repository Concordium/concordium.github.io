The following developer resources help you get started developing on the Concordium network.

Official resources
==================

- See :ref:`Node setup<node-requirements>` for information about the requirements to run a node and the available platforms for nodes.

- See :ref:`SDKs and APIs<sdks-apis>` for links to SDKs and APIs for development

- See :ref:`Smart contracts <introduction>` for general information about smart contracts

    - `Smart contract libraries <https://crates.io/crates/concordium-std>`_
