Update the Desktop Wallet
===========================

The Desktop Wallet installs updates automatically on **macOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux** (though only for the AppImage distribution).

Automatic updates
=================

The Desktop Wallet notifies you when an update is available, and you then have the following options:

* **Restart and Install** to install the update
* **Remind me** to be notified again the next time you open the application.

If you choose to update the application, the update process automatically ensures the integrity of the downloaded files before applying the update.

.. note::
    If the integrity of an update cannot be verified, the update is rejected. The verification step is there to make sure the update is an official release from Concordium, and has not been tampered with by malware.

Manually updating
=================

To manually update the desktop wallet, go to the :ref:`downloads page<downloads-desktop-wallet>` and download the latest version.
