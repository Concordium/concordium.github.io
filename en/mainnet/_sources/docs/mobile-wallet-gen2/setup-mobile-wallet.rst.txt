Request your identity and account

Having set up your passcode and your secret recovery phrase, you must then submit a request for an identity and an account.

Request identity
----------------

#. Read the next page in the app, shortly explaining the Concordium concepts of initial account and identity. Tap **Continue**.

#. Select a third party :term:`identity provider` from the list. Enter your wallet passcode when prompted. An external web page opens within the app.

      :alt: screen with option to select identity provider

#. Enter the information requested by the third-party identity provider. The information might vary depending on the identity provider.
   However, they will ask you to provide photos of identification documents and a selfie.

#. When you have submitted the information to the identity provider, you will have a pending initial account and identity in your app.
   The verification or rejection is usually retrieved from the identity provider within minutes, but check your app frequently to retrieve
   the result. The result can be retrieved for up to seven days.

Once the identity provider has verified your identity you can submit an account. You can see when your identity has been verified by the green check next to the identity name.
