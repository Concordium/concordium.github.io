Pay day is thus when new validators begin validation and updates to delegation and validation take effect, such as increasing stake, restaking preferences, and adding delegation. In the case of decreasing stake or removing delegation or validation, there is a longer cool-down period, after which the change is executed at the <strong>next pay day after the cool-down period ends</strong>. The cool-down period is 3 weeks. Pay day is every 24 hours (i.e., 24 epochs) at approximately 09:00 UTC on Mainnet and approximately 12:00 UTC on Testnet.
