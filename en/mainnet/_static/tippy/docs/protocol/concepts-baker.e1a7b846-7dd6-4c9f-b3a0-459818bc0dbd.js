The stakes of validators and delegators are updated each pay day (but the changes for each pay day are fixed one epoch before). Pay day is thus when new validators begin validation and updates to delegation and validation take effect, such as increasing stake, restaking preferences, and adding delegation. In the case of decreasing stake or removing delegation or validation, there is a longer cool-down period, after which the change is executed at the <strong>next pay day after the cool-down period ends</strong>. The cool-down period is 3 weeks. Pay day is every 24 hours (i.e., 24 epochs) at approximately 09:00 UTC on Mainnet and approximately 12:00 UTC on Testnet.

The protocol offers high transaction throughput and lower confirmation time because a block can be produced as soon as the previous block has been signed. The protocol proceeds by rounds. In each round, a predetermined leader among the validators should produce a block. The other validators then sign this block, and their collective signatures are aggregated to form a quorum certificate (QC). This quorum certificate is then included in the next block. If the leader fails to produce a block in the round, or not enough signatures were gathered for a QC, then the validators will instead send timeout messages, which are aggregated to form a timeout certificate (TC). Each block always contains a quorum certificate and may contain a timeout certificate for the previous round if and only if the previous round timed out. When blocks on a common chain in two consecutive rounds have quorum certificates, the block in the first of these rounds (together with its ancestors) is considered final. At this point, the protocol ensures that it cannot be rolled back. The two consecutive blocks must also be within the same epoch.</p></dd>", "a[href=\"../resources/glossary.html#term-Epoch\"]": "<dt id=\"term-Epoch\">Epoch</dt><dd><p>A time period that is approximately one hour on testnet and mainnet.
