Run and manage a node on MacOS
==============================

This guide describes how to run and manage a node on macOS. You can also run a node using :ref:`Docker <run-a-node>`, :ref:`Ubuntu <run-node-ubuntu>`, or :ref:`Windows <run-node-windows>`.

Prerequisites
=============

- Run macOS 10.14 or later.
- Have the administrator password to your computer.
- Meet the :ref:`minimum system requirements<node-requirements>` for running a node.

.. Note::

  Subscribe to the `Mainnet status page <https://status.mainnet.concordium.software/>`_ or `Testnet status page <https://status.testnet.concordium.software/>`_ and the `release information on Discourse <https://support.concordium.software/c/releases/9>`_ to stay informed about updates and changes that may affect you as a node runner, including node software releases and protocol updates.

  To subscribe to updates on the Mainnet/Testnet status page click **Subscribe** to get all updates or click **Get updates** to choose to get all updates or only updates for specific products.

Install/upgrade and run a node
==============================

.. Note::

   Node version 4.5.0 introduced the GRPC V2 interface which is enabled by
   default on new installations. However on upgrading an existing node the
   configuration is not updated. To enable the new API environment variables
   ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_LISTEN_PORT``
   ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_LISTEN_ADDRESS`` must be set in the ``node.plist``
   settings files for the relevant network as documented below. The default
   ports set on a fresh install for mainnet and testnet are ``20000`` and
   ``20001``, respectively.

   **Example for Mainnet**

   .. code-block:: xml

    <!-- Address of the GRPC V2 server. -->
    <key>CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_LISTEN_ADDRESS</key>
    <string>0.0.0.0</string>

    <!-- Port of the GRPC V2 server. -->
    <key>CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_LISTEN_PORT</key>
    <string>20000</string>

   **Example for Testnet**

   .. code-block:: xml

    <!-- Address of the GRPC V2 server. -->
    <key>CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_LISTEN_ADDRESS</key>
    <string>0.0.0.0</string>

    <!-- Port of the GRPC V2 server. -->
    <key>CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_LISTEN_PORT</key>
    <string>20001</string>

.. Note::

  When upgrading, you can only upgrade one minor version at a time, or from the last release of major version X to major version X+1. You cannot skip versions. For patches, you can skip versions e.g. X.X.0 to X.X.3, or `X.1.1` to `X.2.3`. To download previous node versions, see :ref:`Previous node versions<previous-downloads>`.

  #. Go to :ref:`Downloads<node-downloads>`, and download the latest macOS installer package (.pkg file).

  #. In the folder where you downloaded the .pkg file, double-click the .pkg file. The **Install Concordium Node** program opens.

  #. Click **Allow** to the message saying: *This package will run a program to determine if the software can be installed.* If you have a M1 based Mac, the installer might `ask you to install Rosetta <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861>`_ if you haven't already. Click **Install** if that's the case.

  #. If you already have a version of the node installed, click **OK** to the message saying *Previous Installation Detected*.

  #. Click **Continue** on the *Introduction* page.

  #. Click **Continue** on the *License* page, and then **Agree** to accept the license agreement.

  #. On the *Configuration* page you have the following options.

       :width: 60%

    - **Run a [mainnet/testnet] node at start-up**: When selected, the node runs when the system starts. Choose this option when you plan to use the node frequently and need it to be up-to-date at short notice. If you don’t select this option,   you’ll have to start the node manually when required, for example, when you want to use the Desktop Wallet or Concordium Client. If you choose to start the node manually, it might take longer for the node to get up-to-date with the blockchain depending on when the node was last up-to-date.

    - **Start the node after installation is complete**: The node will automatically start running after the installation is complete. Do not choose this option if you want to make further configuration changes before starting the node.

    - **Report to the network dashboard**: Select this option if you want to publish your node statistics to the relevant dashboard when the node is running. Deselect this option if you don't want your node displayed on the dashboard. If selected, you can view the statistics at the `mainnet dashboard`_.

    - **Public node name**: Specify the name of your node as you want it to appear on the network dashboard if the node reports to the network dashboard. You must enter a name for at least one of the nodes.

  #. Once configured, click **Continue** to go to the **Installation Type** page.

  #. Click **Install** and enter your administrator password. The installer needs the password because it installs the node for all users and runs it as a system service.

  #. Once installed, click **Close**. The following helper applications are now available on your computer (you can view them in the LaunchPad or in the */Applications/Concordium Node* folder):

    - **Concordium Node Start Mainnet**

    - **Concordium Node Stop Mainnet**

    - **Concordium Node Start Testnet**

    - **Concordium Node Stop Testnet**

Verify that the node is running
===============================

The node runs as a background service with no user interface. To verify that it's running, use the **Activity Monitor**.

#. Open the **Activity Monitor** application from the LaunchPad.

#. Look at the list and verify that the following is running:

   - ``concordium-node`` for each node you are running. For example, if you're running a node on both testnet and mainnet, you'll see two instances of concordium-node.

   - ``node-collector`` for each node that reports to a network dashboard.

#. If the node is running properly with reporting to the network dashboard enabled, you can see the name of the node on the `mainnet dashboard`_ or the `testnet dashboard`_.

Connect a node to the Desktop Wallet
------------------------------------

You can also verify that a node is running by connecting it to the Desktop Wallet.

#. In the Desktop Wallet, go to **Settings**, and then select **Node settings**.

   - If you're running the **mainnet** version of the Desktop Wallet, you must connect to a mainnet node. In the **Address field**, enter ``127.0.0.1`` and in the **Port field** enter ``20000``.

   - If you're running the **testnet** version of the Desktop Wallet, you must connect to a testnet node. In the **Address field**, enter ``127.0.0.1`` and in the **Port field** enter ``20001``.

#. Select **Set connection**. If the connection works and the node is running properly, there’s a message saying *Successfully connected*.

Enable inbound connections
==========================

If you are running your node behind a firewall, or behind your home
router, then you will probably only be able to connect to other nodes,
but other nodes will not be able to initiate connections to your node.
This is perfectly fine, and your node will fully participate in the
Concordium network. It will be able to send transactions and,
:ref:`if so configured<become-a-baker>`, to produce blocks.

However you can also make your node an even better network participant
by enabling inbound connections. By default, ``concordium-node`` listens
on port ``8888`` for inbound connections on **Mainnet** and on port ``8889`` for inbound connections on **Testnet**. Depending on your network and
platform configuration you will either need to forward an external port
to ``8888`` or ``8889`` on your router, open it in your firewall, or both. The
details of how this is done will depend on your configuration.

.. _change-node-settings:

Change the node startup settings
================================

If you want to change whether the node services start automatically, you have two options.

- If you're not familiar with using a terminal, the easiest option is to reinstall the macOS node and configure it differently.

- If you're familiar with using a terminal, the following options are available:

  .. note::
     The dollar sign (``$``) in a codeblock means that you should run the command that follows the ``$`` in a terminal.

  - Enable automatic startup of the *node* by running:

    - For mainnet:

      .. code-block:: console

          $sudo ln -s "/Library/Concordium Node/LaunchDaemons/software.concordium.mainnet.node.plist" "/Library/LaunchDaemons/"

    - For testnet:

      .. code-block:: console

          $sudo ln -s "/Library/Concordium Node/LaunchDaemons/software.concordium.testnet.node.plist" "/Library/LaunchDaemons/"

  - Enable automatic startup of the *node-collector* by running:

    - For mainnet:

      .. code-block:: console

         $sudo ln -s "/Library/Concordium Node/LaunchDaemons/software.concordium.mainnet.node-collector.plist" "/Library/LaunchDaemons/"

    - For testnet:

      .. code-block:: console

         $sudo ln -s "/Library/Concordium Node/LaunchDaemons/software.concordium.testnet.node-collector.plist" "/Library/LaunchDaemons/"

  - Disable automatic startup of the *node* by running:

    - For mainnet:

      .. code-block:: console

         $sudo rm "/Library/LaunchDaemons/software.concordium.mainnet.node.plist"

    - For testnet:

      .. code-block:: console

         $sudo rm "/Library/LaunchDaemons/software.concordium.testnet.node.plist"

  - Disable automatic startup of *node-collector* by running:

    - For mainnet:

      .. code-block:: console

         $sudo rm "/Library/LaunchDaemons/software.concordium.mainnet.node-collector.plist"

    - For testnet:

      .. code-block:: console

         $sudo rm "/Library/LaunchDaemons/software.concordium.testnet.node-collector.plist"

.. _node-collector-configuration-macos:

Node collector configuration
============================

Since version 5.3.2 of the node, the collector uses the GRPC V2 interface. Therefore, in order to run the collector, it is required that the node which the collector connects to has the GRPC V2 interface enabled.

.. Note::
   If the node is `configured with TLS <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/blob/main/docs/grpc2.md#grpc-api-v2>`_, then `CONCORDIUM_NODE_COLLECTOR_GRPC_HOST` must be configured such that it uses the domain of the certificate.

Since the GRPC V2 port is different than the GRPC V1 port, you need to change it in the node configuration:

**Example for Mainnet**

 .. code-block:: xml

    <!-- gRPC host to collect from. -->
    <key>CONCORDIUM_NODE_COLLECTOR_GRPC_HOST</key>
    <string>http://localhost:20000</string>

**Example for Testnet**

  .. code-block:: xml

    <!-- gRPC host to collect from. -->
    <key>CONCORDIUM_NODE_COLLECTOR_GRPC_HOST</key>
    <string>http://localhost:20001</string>

.. _configure-baker-macos:

Configure a node as a validator
===============================

For information about validation on a MacOS node, see :ref:`baker-macos`.

View node logs
==============

There are two ways to view the logs:

- With the **Console.app** you can start recording logs and view them, but you can't see logs from the past.

  - Open the **Console app**, click on the **Start** button to begin recording logs.

  - In the search bar, enter the following and press enter:

    - For mainnet logs: ``software.concordium.mainnet.node``

    - For testnet logs: ``software.conordium.testnet.node``

  - Then click on the small **Any** button in the search bar and select **Subsystem** from the list of options.

- With a terminal and *log show* you can view logs from the past and as they are logged.

  - Open a terminal.

  - Use the ``log`` command by entering:

    - For mainnet logs: ``log show --predicate 'subsystem == "software.concordium.mainnet.node"'``

    - For testnet logs: ``log show --predicate 'subsystem == "software.concordium.testnet.node"'``

  - You can filter the logs with additional parameters, such as start and end date. Enter ``log show --help`` to see the parameters available.

Synchronize a node with the network
===================================

When you start a node for the first time, it can take a while to synchronize
the node with the rest of the network, since it has to get all blocks from
its peers. That is why all node distributions since 6.1 come with out of band
catchup enabled. This will speed up the initial catchup and during out of
band catchup the node will not have any peers.

The out of band catchup can be kept enabled even after the node is caught up,
but is not necessary. If you wish to disable it do the the following:

#. Remove the environment variables from the configuration file:

   - For mainnet:

     - Edit ``"/Library/Concordium Node/LaunchDaemons/software.concordium.mainnet.node.plist"`` as an
       administrator and remove the following in the *EnviromentVariables* section:

       .. code-block:: xml

         <key>CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_DOWNLOAD_BLOCKS_FROM</key>
         <string>https://catchup.mainnet.concordium.software/blocks.idx</string>

   - For testnet:

     - Edit ``"/Library/Concordium Node/LaunchDaemons/software.concordium.testnet.node.plist"`` as an
       administrator and remove the following in the *EnviromentVariables* section:

       .. code-block:: xml

         <key>CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_DOWNLOAD_BLOCKS_FROM</key>
         <string>https://catchup.testnet.concordium.com/blocks.idx</string>

#. Restart the appropriate node by running the application **Concordium Node Stop [Mainnet/Testnet]** (if running) and then
   **Concordium Node Start [Mainnet/Testnet]**.

Uninstall a macOS node
======================

#. Press **Cmd + Space** on your keyboard to open **Spotlight Search** or click the Spotlight icon in the menu bar.

#. Search for ``Concordium Node Uninstaller`` and open the application that is found.

#. You now have two options:

   - To delete the node and keep the data and keys, click **Yes**.

   - To delete the node as well as data and keys, click **Yes, and delete data**.
     (Make sure to back up your keys beforehand).
