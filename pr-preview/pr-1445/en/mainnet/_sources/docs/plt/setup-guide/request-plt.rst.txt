Request PLT issuance
=====================

This guide explains how to request the issuance of a custom Protocol-Level Token (PLT) on testnet for testing and development purposes.

.. _plt-overview:

Overview
========

Creating a new PLT is a chain-governance operation performed by the Concordium team through a chain creation update. The process involves defining token parameters and creating metadata to create the PLT on the network.

Once created, the PLT information is stored on-chain, including any initial supply that gets minted. After creation, token-governance operations and token-holder operations can be invoked for the new token type.

.. _plt-metadata:

PLT metadata
============


To provide visual assets like token thumbnails and images, create a metadata JSON file and host it off-chain. You can read more about the **metadata URL** parameter in `this section <https://proposals.concordium.com/CIS/cis-7.html#metadata-url>`_ of the CIS-7 standard, and about the metadata format in `this chapter <https://proposals.concordium.com/CIS/cis-7.html#token-metadata-format>`_ of the standard.

An option is to upload it to IPFS or another public storage online. For a tutorial on how to use IPFS by running a node, read :ref:`this article <upload-nft>`. Alternatively, you can use a pinning solution such as https://pinata.cloud/ or any other decentralized storage systems. The URL of the metadata file will be added to the PLT definition.

.. _plt-request-process:

Request process
===============

Follow these steps to request PLT issuance on testnet:

1. **Prepare your token metadata**

Token definition properties
===========================

For a detailed explanation of the parameters, please read the `CIS-7: Protocol-level Tokens (PLTs) Standard <https://proposals.concordium.com/CIS/cis-7.html#common-types>`_. Your PLT will be created with the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Property
     - Description
   * - Symbol
     - Ticker symbol for unique identification on-chain
   * - Token name
     - Full name of the token (should be unique)
   * - Decimals
     - Number of decimals in token representation
   * - MetadataUrl
     - URL for token metadata with additional information
   * - Nominated Account
     - Address that can perform token-governance operations
   * - Allowlist
     - Whether token supports an allow list
   * - Denylist
     - Whether token supports a deny list
   * - Initial supply
     - Initial tokens minted to the token-governance account
   * - Burnable
     - Whether tokens can be burnt
   * - Mintable
     - Whether additional tokens can be minted

.. _what-happens-next:

What happens next
=================

* Tokens will be issued manually by the Concordium team
* The tokens will be issued directly to your nominated account address
