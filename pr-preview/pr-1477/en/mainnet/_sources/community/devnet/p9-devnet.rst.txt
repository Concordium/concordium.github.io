P9 DevNet - Protocol-level tokens (archived)
============================================

**Status: Archived/For Reference Only**

The P9 DevNet was the previous iteration of the Concordium experimental network. It became public in April 2025 and focused primarily on the initial rollout and testing of protocol-level tokens (PLTs).

While the network may remain online for a period, all new feature testing has transitioned to the P10 DevNet. This page is kept for reference regarding the features and development timeline achieved during the P9 phase.

Primary features tested on P9 DevNet
====================================

The core objective of P9 DevNet was to enable early exploration, experimentation, and development of solutions utilizing Concordium's protocol-level tokens (PLTs).
This network successfully unlocked powerful new scenarios for payment processing, available only thanks to Concordium's ID-layer:

- **Geofencing Payments**:  Conditional transactions based on geographic location (e.g., allowing payments only if the receiver is in the EU).
- **Verify & Pay**:  Enable age-restricted purchases by integrating identity verification directly into the payment process
- **Scheduled Transfers**:  Automate periodic payments, like rent or subscriptions.
- **Smart Payment Lock**:  Execute transactions conditionally (e.g., payments triggered upon delivery or trade finance document verification).

P9 DevNet launch timeline
=========================

- **End of April 2025:** P9 DevNet goes live; invite-only building begins.
- **June 2025:** First two scenarios (Geofenced Payments, Verify & Pay) are delivered.
- **November 2025:** Delivery of second two scenarios (Scheduled Transfers and Smart Payment Locks).
