Company identity creation
=========================

A company identity is for companies that need an identity and accounts on the Concordium blockchain, but don't want that identity to belong to a specific person. Company identities are therefore issued with documents that identify the company and not an individual. Company identities are only relevant for a few companies, such as crypto exchanges.

Currently, Concordium offers two identity providers for company identities:

* Global FinReg - Can be accessed directly through |bw| or |cryptox|
* Notabene - You can't use the Desktop Wallet, |bw| or |cryptox| to create a company identity.

   * for Notabene, you need to use the :ref:`Concordium Company ID tool <downloads-auxiliary-tools>`, and you need to communicate directly with the identity provider. `This page <https://notaben.notion.site/Entity-verification-next-1b4fbcd8e32042e1ac3b0018a3cc27bc>`_ describes Notabene's process, including recovery of company identities.

The information below describes how to create a company identity, how to create accounts with a company identity, and how to recover a company identity. If you experience issues with the Concordium Company ID tool, please contact Concordiumâ€™s technical support via support@concordium.software.

Requesting a company identity through Global FinReg
===================================================

To create a company identity using Global FinReg, first :ref:`download <downloads-cryptox>` the |bw| or the |cryptox|, then follow the steps outlined below.

Initiate the request from a Concordium wallet
---------------------------------------------

* Open the |bw| or |cryptox|

* In the main menu, click on **Identities**.

Complete verification on the Global FinReg platform
---------------------------------------------------

* Log in to your existing Global FinReg account or sign up for a new account.

* Enter your company's `Legal Entity Identifier (LEI code) <https://www.lei-worldwide.com/what-is-a-legal-entity-identifier.html>`_. Alternatively, you can enter the entity details of the company.

* Upload entity documents from a primary source that are no older than three months. Acceptable documents include:

   * Business registry documents
   * Documents from a financial supervisory authority (FSA)

* Provide information about the company's Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) or Authorized Signatory.

.. note::

   A UBO is generally defined as an individual who holds a minimum of 10-25% (depending on jurisdiction) of capital or voting rights in the underlying entity.

* Verify the UBO or Authorized Signatory through the online verification tool using a passport or driver's license.

Finalize validation and create accounts
---------------------------------------

* Navigate to the account management tab in Global FinReg.

* Review all submitted documents and information for accuracy.

* If all information is correct, click **Approve** to finalize the verification process.

* Upon approval, your wallet ID will be validated and ready for use on the Concordium blockchain.

After completing these steps, you can use your company identity to create accounts on the Concordium blockchain as described in the :ref:`Create account<create-account>` guide.

Requesting a company identity through  Notabene
===============================================

Once you have dowloaded the :ref:`Concordium Company ID tool <downloads-auxiliary-tools>` for your platform and installed it, you should choose your network, either Mainnet or Testnet. A default Concordium node URL is used, but you can enter your node URL, if desired.

Request identity
----------------

#. Click **Request identity**.

#. Read the information and click **Proceed**.

#. Write down or save your seedphrase by clicking the copy button to copy your seedphrase to the clipboard and remember to go to the clipboard and save the file. Keep your seedphrase secure as you will need it to create accounts or recover the identity. Click **Proceed**.

   .. image:: images/company-id-request.png
      :alt: company id tool screen showing identities related to seedphrase and option to select

#. Enter your seedphrase to verify that you have recorded it correctly. Click **Proceed**.

#. Click **Generate request.json**. The command outputs the ``request.json`` file. The request should be sent to the identity provider through a trusted channel. Store the auxiliary output securely.

   - For **Mainnet** requests: Send the file to ania@notabene.id together with any other required identity data as described in the `entity verification instructions <https://notaben.notion.site/Entity-verification-next-1b4fbcd8e32042e1ac3b0018a3cc27bc>`_.

   - For **Testnet** requests: Send the file to support@concordium.software with the subject line "Test company identity".

When the identity has been verified successfully, you will receive an email with an identity object file named ``id-object.json``. Store this file securely as you need it to create accounts and regenerate account keys.

Create account
--------------

After obtaining the ``id-object.json`` identity object from the identity provider you can create accounts on the chain. The Concordium Company ID tool requires the identity object returned by the identity provider to create accounts on chain.

**Create account** can also be used to regenerate the keys for an old account. In this case, you would need ``id-object.json`` file again. If you have lost that file, use :ref:`Identity Recovery<id-recovery>` to retrieve it so you can recover your accounts and save the account keys. After selecting Identity Recovery, enter your seed phrase. If there are accounts on chain related to the seed phrase, you will be able to store the keys of those accounts.

#. Click **Create Account**.

#. Enter your seedphrase in the Enter seedphrase field. In the Identity object file field click to navigate to the location of the stored ``id-object.json`` file. Click **Get Accounts**.

   .. image:: images/company-id-create-acct.png
      :alt: company id tool screen showing seedphrase field and file selection box

#. On the next screen, click **Create Account** to create an account with this company identity. When prompted, save the ``account-keys.json`` in a secure location as you will need them to interact with the account on-chain. You can click **Create account** again to create another account.

.. note::

   If you are trying to recover the ``account-keys.json`` file(s), you can also use **Create Account**. After entering your seedphrase and selecting your ``id-object.json`` file you will see a list of account associated with this seedphrase and ID object. Click **Save** to save the ``account-keys.json`` for that account.

   .. image:: images/company-id-acct-keys.png
      :alt: company id tool screen showing seedphrase field and file selection box

.. dropdown:: Format of the key files

   Both initial account keys and subsequent account keys are stored in JSON files. The unencrypted data is a JSON record with a number of fields. This is the same format as exported by the other Concordium wallets (except Desktop Wallet). For sending transactions the fields that are relevant are:

   - ``accountKeys`` contains the account keys. It has the following format:

      .. code-block:: json

         {
            "environment": "testnet",
            "type": "concordium-browser-wallet-account",
            "v": 0,
            "value": {
               "accountKeys": {
                  "keys": {
                     "0": {
                        "keys": {
                           "0": {
                              "signKey": "81e7d8e625a00b6f5b97dd8b0a97807212e6b0ceb4fd206e715b97536c83caea",
                              "verifyKey": "03164c9e6654c1544a0e7d33780df425c695f6222fda75c047aea5186680e491"
                           }
                        },
                        "threshold": 1
                     }
                  },
                  "threshold": 1
               },
               "address": "3LfTBXYtc6TEjuJiKgLpFGEtGRMPhBsKRB76Q4x91LZPWSmQ9Z",
               "credentials": {
                  "0": "843785aef9446c8e5b2c6922863e49231b93fb9950909c3166e7c287357a1a495ecfbdcb6ca36ea5998fef2c9dee91f8"
               }
            }
         }

      In this example the account has a single credential with index 0, and that credential has a single key with index 0. The private key is 03164c9e6654c1544a0e7d33780df425c695f6222fda75c047aea5186680e491 and its public key is 81e7d8e625a00b6f5b97dd8b0a97807212e6b0ceb4fd206e715b97536c83caea.

   - ``address`` is the address of the account, e.g.,

      .. code-block:: json

         "address": "3LfTBXYtc6TEjuJiKgLpFGEtGRMPhBsKRB76Q4x91LZPWSmQ9Z"

Import created accounts into ``concordium-client``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use the accounts created in the Concordium Company ID tool, you must use Concordium Client. You can download it :ref:`here<concordium-node-and-client-download>`. For information about how to use it, see :ref:`concordium-client`.

The account keys are primarily meant for clients to integrate into their key management solution and their software, e.g., an exchange integrating their trading platform with the Concordium chain.

However, if the ``account-keys.json`` file is not encrypted it can be imported into ``concordium-client`` with the command:

.. code-block:: console

   concordium-client config account import account-keys.json --name my-account

``--name`` is mandatory and will name the account according to the given value ("my-account" in the example above).

The initial account keys cannot be directly imported into ``concordium-client``.

Once you have created accounts, you can request CCDs for testing. To request CCDs for testing, run the following command:

``curl -X PUT https://wallet-proxy.testnet.concordium.com/v0/testnetGTUDrop/3GXM6cEuAwEA47EEtFpax9PLhMWchWmkaPmNZmW1kbDaWaKBxV`` where you replace 3GXM6cEuAwEA47EEtFpax9PLhMWchWmkaPmNZmW1kbDaWaKBxV with the account address that should receive the CCDs.

.. _id-recovery:

Notabene Identity recovery
==========================

If the identity object used to create credentials is lost, it can be recovered from the identity provider by generating a recovery request using the 24 words used when the identity was originally created. Recover identity generates an identity recovery request to be sent to the identity provider.

#. Click **Identity Recovery**.

#. Enter your seedphrase in the Enter seedphrase field. And click **Find identities**.

#. You see a list of accounts associated with the seedphrase. It is possible to save the account keys that can be ussed to interact with the account on the chain. Indices that are to the left of the account address are pointing to the identity index, being the first value and the account index being the second value (0,0). In the Identities to recover drop-down, select the identity you want to recover. There will always be one additional index on the list for selection to be sure that request can be generated for more than one identity. This is mainly useful in cases where first identity object was lost or unused to create accounts. Click **Generate recovery request**. The command outputs the ``recovery-request.json`` file. The request should be sent to the identity provider through a trusted channel. When the request has been verified successfully, you will receive an email with an identity object. Store this file securely as you need it to create accounts on the chain.

   .. image:: images/account-creation.png
      :alt: company id tool screen showing identities related to seedphrase and option to select

- For Mainnet requests: Send the file to ania@notabene.id together with any other required identity data as described in the `entity verification instructions <https://notaben.notion.site/Entity-verification-next-1b4fbcd8e32042e1ac3b0018a3cc27bc>`_.

- For Testnet requests: Send the file to support@concordium.software with the subject line "Recover company identity".

When the recovery request has been verified successfully, you will receive an email with the identity object file named ``id-object.json`` that you lost. Store this file securely as you need it to create accounts.

Global FinReg Identity recovery
===============================

The recovery process for Global FinReg identities differs from the Notabene process described above. Since Global FinReg identities are created directly through the |bw| or |cryptox|, identity recovery is performed through the wallet recovery process.

For detailed instructions on wallet recovery, please refer to the :ref:`recover your wallet <recover-wallet>` guide.
