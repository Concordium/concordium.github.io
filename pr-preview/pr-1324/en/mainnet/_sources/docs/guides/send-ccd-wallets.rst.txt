Send CCD
========

This topic describes how you can send CCD from an account when only one participant is required to sign the transfer.

.. Note::
   All transfers and transactions cost a fee. The fee is based on the set NRG for that transaction and the current exchange rate.
   The cost of transaction fees is stable in Euros, and therefore the price in CCD varies depending on the CCD to EUR exchange rate. The fee will always be deducted from the **Balance** of the account, so it is important to have some available CCDs to cover fees.
   You can see the fee in the transaction log.

.. Warning::
   Make sure you have enough funds in your disposable balance to cover transaction fees.

.. Note::
    On Testnet you can request CCDs for testing purposes. Use the button in an account to request 20000 CCDs.

.. dropdown:: |cryptox|

    #. On the Accounts screen tap |cryptoX-send| on the account from which you want to send CCD. You can also tap |cryptoX-send| on the account's balance screen.

    #. Enter the amount you want to transfer.

    #. You can paste the recipient address, choose a recipient that already exists in your **Address Book**, or tap **Scan QR** to add a new one.

    #. Optionally you can add a memo to your transaction. A memo is a short message that will be shown with the transaction. Memos are publicly visible on the chain, so be careful what you write. Adding a memo will also increase the transaction fee.

        .. Warning::
            Transaction memos are public, permanent and visible to everyone on the blockchain. Therefore, carefully review all information before you submit the memo to the blockchain.

    #. Tap **Continue**.

    #. Tap **Send funds**.

    #. Go to **Accounts** and select the relevant account.

    #. Select **Send**.

    #. In the right pane, enter the amount of CCD that you want to send. If the amount you want to transfer including the transfer fee exceeds the amount in your account, you’ll see a message saying **Insufficient funds**. This means that there's not enough CCD in the account, and you’ll have to change the amount. Enter a **Memo** if you want to send a message to the recipient along with the amount. Note that there's a fee associated with sending a memo and the fee depends on the size of the memo in bytes. Click **Select Recipient**.

    7. Review the transaction on the LEDGER device and verify that the information matches the **Transaction details** in the Desktop Wallet. Navigate to the right and verify the sender address is correct. Continue navigating to the right and verify that the recipient address is correct.

    8. Press both buttons to sign the transaction. In the Desktop Wallet, you can see that the transfer has been submitted to the chain. Select **Finish**.
