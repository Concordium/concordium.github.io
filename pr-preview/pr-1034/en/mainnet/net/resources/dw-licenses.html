<span class="go">      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</span>
<span class="go">      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</span>
<span class="go">      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</span>
<span class="go">      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</span>
<span class="go">      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
<span class="go">      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
<span class="go">      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
<span class="go">      as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

<span class="go">   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>
<span class="go">      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</span>
<span class="go">      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</span>
<span class="go">      meet the following conditions:</span>

<span class="go">      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span>
<span class="go">          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

<span class="go">      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
<span class="go">          stating that You changed the files; and</span>

<span class="go">      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>
<span class="go">          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</span>
<span class="go">          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</span>
<span class="go">          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
<span class="go">          the Derivative Works; and</span>

<span class="go">      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
<span class="go">          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
<span class="go">          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
<span class="go">          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
<span class="go">          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
<span class="go">          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
<span class="go">          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
<span class="go">          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
<span class="go">          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
<span class="go">          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
<span class="go">          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
<span class="go">          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
<span class="go">          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
<span class="go">          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
<span class="go">          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
<span class="go">          as modifying the License.</span>

<span class="go">      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
<span class="go">      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
<span class="go">      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
<span class="go">      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
<span class="go">      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
<span class="go">      the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="go">   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
<span class="go">      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
<span class="go">      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
<span class="go">      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
<span class="go">      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
<span class="go">      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
<span class="go">      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="go">   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
<span class="go">      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
<span class="go">      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
<span class="go">      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="go">   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
<span class="go">      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
<span class="go">      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
<span class="go">      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
<span class="go">      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
<span class="go">      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
<span class="go">      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
<span class="go">      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
<span class="go">      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="go">   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
<span class="go">      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
<span class="go">      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
<span class="go">      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
<span class="go">      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
<span class="go">      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
<span class="go">      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
<span class="go">      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
<span class="go">      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
<span class="go">      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
<span class="go">      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="go">   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
<span class="go">      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
<span class="go">      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
<span class="go">      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
<span class="go">      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
<span class="go">      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
<span class="go">      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
<span class="go">      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
<span class="go">      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
<span class="go">      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

<span class="go">   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

<span class="go">      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>

<span class="go">   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>

<span class="go">      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span>

<span class="go">      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
<span class="go">          stating that You changed the files; and</span>

<span class="go">      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>

<span class="go">          the Derivative Works; and</span>

<span class="go">      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
<span class="go">          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
<span class="go">          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
<span class="go">          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
<span class="go">          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
<span class="go">          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
<span class="go">          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
<span class="go">          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
<span class="go">          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
<span class="go">          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
<span class="go">          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
<span class="go">          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
<span class="go">          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
<span class="go">          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
<span class="go">          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
<span class="go">          as modifying the License.</span>

<span class="go">      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
<span class="go">      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
<span class="go">      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
<span class="go">      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
<span class="go">      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
<span class="go">      the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="go">   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
<span class="go">      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
<span class="go">      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
<span class="go">      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
<span class="go">      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
<span class="go">      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
<span class="go">      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="go">   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
<span class="go">      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
<span class="go">      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
<span class="go">      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="go">   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
<span class="go">      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
<span class="go">      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
<span class="go">      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
<span class="go">      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
<span class="go">      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
<span class="go">      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
<span class="go">      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
<span class="go">      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="go">   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
<span class="go">      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
<span class="go">      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
<span class="go">      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
<span class="go">      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
<span class="go">      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
<span class="go">      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
<span class="go">      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
<span class="go">      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
<span class="go">      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
<span class="go">      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="go">   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
<span class="go">      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
<span class="go">      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
<span class="go">      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
<span class="go">      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
<span class="go">      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
<span class="go">      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
<span class="go">      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
<span class="go">      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
<span class="go">      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE</span>
<span class="go">==========================</span>

<span class="go">Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting</span>
<span class="go">Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands</span>
<span class="go">as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python&#39;s</span>
<span class="go">principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.</span>

<span class="go">In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for</span>
<span class="go">National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)</span>
<span class="go">in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the</span>
<span class="go">software.</span>

<span class="go">In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to</span>
<span class="go">BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same</span>
<span class="go">year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became</span>
<span class="go">Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see</span>
<span class="go">https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization</span>
<span class="go">created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.</span>
<span class="go">Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.</span>

<span class="go">All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for</span>
<span class="go">the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python</span>
<span class="go">releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes</span>
<span class="go">the various releases.</span>

<span class="go">    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-</span>
<span class="go">                    from                                compatible? (1)</span>

<span class="go">    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes</span>
<span class="go">    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes</span>
<span class="go">    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no</span>

<span class="go">    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes</span>
<span class="go">    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes</span>
<span class="go">    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes</span>
<span class="go">    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes</span>
<span class="go">    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes</span>

<span class="go">Footnotes:</span>

<span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(1)</span> <span class="go">GPL-compatible doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re distributing Python under</span>
<span class="go">    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute</span>
<span class="go">    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The</span>
<span class="go">    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with</span>
<span class="go">    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don&#39;t.</span>

<span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(2)</span> <span class="go">According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,</span>
<span class="go">    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to</span>
<span class="go">    CNRI, however, Stallman&#39;s lawyer has told CNRI&#39;s lawyer that 1.6.1</span>
<span class="go">    is &quot;not incompatible&quot; with the GPL.</span>

<span class="go">Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido&#39;s</span>
<span class="go">direction to make these releases possible.</span>

<span class="go">     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
<span class="go">     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
<span class="go">     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
<span class="go">     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>

<span class="go">     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
<span class="go">     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
<span class="go">     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="go">  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
<span class="go">     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
<span class="go">     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
<span class="go">     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
<span class="go">     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
<span class="go">     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
<span class="go">     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
<span class="go">     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
<span class="go">     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
<span class="go">     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>
