Examples of this would be club membership credentials, reward programs, etc. There are no requirements imposed on who can be an issuer of these credentials, and in contrast to protocol level identities, the Web3 ID credentials can be revoked according to the logic imposed by the issuer. This could be that the credential holder can revoke it, the credential expires, or the issuer or some other third party has rights to revoke it.
