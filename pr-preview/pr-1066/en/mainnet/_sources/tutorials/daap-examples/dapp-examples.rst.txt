The dApps are written in React.

Piggy bank, wCCD, eSealing, sponsored Transactions, smart contract deploy and initialize tool, and wallet test bench use the NPM library
`@concordium/react-components <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@concordium/react-components>`__
to implement integrations to the |bw| and |mw-gen2| using WalletConnect.
