<h3>12.2 No advice; No reliance<a class="headerlink" href="#no-advice-no-reliance" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>12.2.1 All information visible on the App or in connection with your use of the App is for informational purposes only. The App is not intended as, and does not provide, any investment or financial advice. With respect to any financial or investment decisions, we recommend you conduct your own research to properly evaluate the risks and benefits of any transaction.

<section id="digital-asset-volatility-and-characteristics">
<h3>12.3 Digital asset volatility and characteristics<a class="headerlink" href="#digital-asset-volatility-and-characteristics" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>12.3.1 Using, buying, holding and selling digital assets involve certain risks of financial loss. Any digital asset may be subject to fluctuations in value, including a total loss of value. The volatility and unpredictability of the price of digital assets relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time. The nature of digital assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack. You acknowledge these risks and agree that we cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or loss of value.</p>
<p>12.3.2 Digital assets and their underlying blockchain networks are complex emerging technologies that are typically globally distributed across multiple, unaffiliated nodes. They may experience delays, halts or go offline as a result of errors, forks, attacks or other unforeseeable reasons. They are also subject to speculative interest and regulatory attention, which may contribute to price volatility and liquidity constraints. The compatibility of a digital asset or with Third Party Services on the App does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the digital asset or its underlying technology and should not be treated as a substitute for your own understanding of the risks specific to each digital asset. We provide no warranty as to the suitability of any digital assets or Third Party Services and assume no fiduciary duty to you in connection with your use of the App.</p>
<p>12.3.3 All digital asset transactions are irreversible. You accept all consequences of using or transacting digital assets. Once you send digital assets to an address, you accept the risk that you may permanently lose access to it. You assume all liability for any losses incurred as a result of your transactions or transfers of digital assets. You are solely liable for verifying the accuracy of any external wallet address and the identity of the recipient. We do not control any blockchain network and cannot guarantee that any transfer will be confirmed or transferred successfully by the network. We are not responsible for any losses or for taking any actions to attempt to recover any lost, stolen, misdirected or irrecoverable digital assets.</p>

Such changes may affect the App. You assume full responsibility for monitoring such technological changes and understanding their impact on your digital assets.</p>
<p>12.4.2 The digital assets and their underlying networks are under development and continue to evolve. As such, they may be subject to material and sudden changes that may have a significant impact on the availability, usability or value of a particular digital asset. In addition, as a general matter, the operations, functionalities, development and distributions of digital assets and their underlying networks are beyond Company’s control. You agree not to hold Company liable for any related losses.</p>
<p>12.4.3 Blockchain networks are susceptible to various attacks such as an attack in which an attacker gains control of a requisite mining or validating power on the network. Company cannot prevent or mitigate attacks on blockchain networks and has no obligation to engage in activity in relation to such attacks.</p>

<section id="data-privacy">
<h2>15. DATA PRIVACY<a class="headerlink" href="#data-privacy" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>15.1 When you use Concordium Software as your Remote Procedure Call (“RPC”) provider in the App, certain information about you is collected. When you use Concordium Software as your default RPC provider, Concordium Software will collect your IP address and your blockchain account address when you send a transaction. As Concordium Software believes in a high degree of privacy, only the initial two parts (bytes) of the IP address will be logged while the last two parts are anonymized. The account address will also not be logged; however, you agree, understand, and acknowledge that your account information will be broadcast publicly on the Concordium blockchain. If you are using your own Concordium node or a third-party RPC provider with the Wallet, then Concordium Software will not collect your IP address or Concordium account address (but you should be aware your information will be subject to whatever information collection is performed by the RPC provider you are using and their terms regarding such collection).</p>
<p>15.2 When you create a Concordium Digital Identity Certificate (“Identity Certificate”) with a Third Party Service, you will enter an agreement directly with such Third Party Service and such Third Party Service will store data about you. In this case, the Third Party Service’s privacy policy and terms of use apply. The Third Party Service may store a copy of the Identity Certificate for subsequent re-issuance; however, the Third Party Service will not have access to your blockchain account address. The App stores the Identity Certificate in encrypted form, and it is not visible to Concordium Software or on the Concordium blockchain. You may choose to reveal and make publicly available any attributes associated with your account. However, if you reveal such attributes, these attributes will be visible on the blockchain, and can never be deleted.</p>
<p>To collect information about the usage of the App, while preserving as much user privacy as possible, we use cookie-less tracking in the App. We use this information to administer the App and we analyze this information to improve and enhance the App by expanding its features and functionality and tailoring it to our users’ needs and preferences. This includes tracking of App versions.</p>
