Developer Spotlight
===================

Hello, developers!

We are excited to introduce **the Developer Spotlight**, an initiative that highlights promising projects built on Concordium. This is your opportunity to share your work, present insights, and gain visibility within the ecosystem. Selected projects that align with Concordium’s vision will be featured in the community.

Why Participate?
----------------

If selected, your project may benefit from:

- An interview, blog post, or demo presentation — we will collaborate with you to produce content that best represents your work.
- Exposure to a wide audience, including potential users, partners, and investors.
- Community and expert feedback to help improve and shape your project.

Who Can Apply?
--------------

We welcome projects that:

- Leverage Concordium technologies, such as the ID Layer or Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).
- Demonstrate real-world adoption potential and align with Concordium’s core principles.
- Are open source (preferred), although proprietary solutions contributing to the Concordium ecosystem may also be considered.

How to Apply
------------

To nominate your project, submit an application using the following form:
`Submit your application <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvWKkjXlBTVN3KiW4EpWr1Tx2CSJMSYb9uzU_z-xZzxi4e4g/viewform?usp=dialog>`_

What to Expect
--------------

1. Applications are collected and reviewed by the Concordium team.
2. Selected projects will be contacted to begin content development (interview, blog, or demo).
3. Final content will be published and promoted within the Concordium community.

Tips for a Strong Application
-----------------------------

- Clearly explain how your project utilizes Concordium’s technology.
- Share your development journey — including both challenges and achievements.
- Include links to demos, GitHub repositories, or visual materials that highlight your work.

We look forward to learning more about your project and sharing it with the wider Concordium ecosystem.
