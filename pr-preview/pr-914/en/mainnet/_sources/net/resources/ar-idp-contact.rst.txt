.. note::

    On Testnet, the Concordium identity provider is a genesis identity provider that exists to provide generic identities for test purposes. On Mainnet, there are special, non-functional, genesis identity provider 0 and anonymity revoker 1. These are the identity provider and anonymity revoker for the foundation's genesis accounts, and only those accounts. Their public keys were generated by a special hashing construction from digits of pi, so that their secret keys are not known to anyone. These keys will not be used for anything else.
