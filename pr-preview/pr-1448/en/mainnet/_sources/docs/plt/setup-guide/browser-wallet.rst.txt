================================

This guide explains how to download and install the custom DevNet Browser Wallet, which is required for connecting to Concordium's DevNet environment and working with Protocol-Level Tokens (PLTs).

About the DevNet Browser Wallet
================================

The DevNet Browser Wallet is a special edition of the Concordium Browser Wallet that supports connections to custom networks, including DevNet. This version is required as the standard Browser Wallet only connects to :term:`Mainnet` and :term:`Testnet`.

   .. note::
      This feature will be incorporated into the standard Browser Wallet in future versions, but currently requires this special edition.

2. **Unzip the downloaded file**

   Extract the contents of the zip file to a location on your computer.

3. **Add to Chrome browser**

   a. In Chrome, navigate to *Extensions* → *Manage Extensions*
