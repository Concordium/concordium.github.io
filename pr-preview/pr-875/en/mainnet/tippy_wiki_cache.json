{"Port_(computer_networking)": "<p>In computer networking, a <b>port</b> or <b>port number</b> is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service. At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service. A port at the software level is identified for each transport protocol and address combination by the port number assigned to it. The most common transport protocols that use port numbers are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP); those port numbers are 16-bit unsigned numbers.</p>", "HTTPS": "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/HTTP_logo.svg/320px-HTTP_logo.svg.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia thumbnail\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px;\"><p><b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure</b> (<b>HTTPS</b>) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It uses encryption for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as <b>HTTP over TLS</b>, or <b>HTTP over SSL</b>.</p>", "ElGamal_encryption": "<p>In cryptography, the <b>ElGamal encryption system</b> is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange. It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985. ElGamal encryption is used in the free GNU Privacy Guard software, recent versions of PGP, and other cryptosystems. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a variant of the ElGamal signature scheme, which should not be confused with ElGamal encryption.</p>", "InterPlanetary_File_System": "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Ipfs-logo-1024-ice-text.png/320px-Ipfs-logo-1024-ice-text.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia thumbnail\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px;\"><p>The <b>InterPlanetary File System</b> (<b>IPFS</b>) is a protocol, hypermedia and file sharing peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.

These keys are most often strings, with links between nodes defined not by the entire key, but by individual characters. In order to access a key, the trie is traversed depth-first, following the links between nodes, which represent each character in the key.</p>", "Ciphertext": "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Zimmermann_Telegram.jpeg/320px-Zimmermann_Telegram.jpeg\" alt=\"Wikipedia thumbnail\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px;\"><p>In cryptography, <b>ciphertext</b> or <b>cyphertext</b> is the result of encryption performed on plaintext using an algorithm, called a cipher. Ciphertext is also known as encrypted or encoded information because it contains a form of the original plaintext that is unreadable by a human or computer without the proper cipher to decrypt it. This process prevents the loss of sensitive information via hacking. Decryption, the inverse of encryption, is the process of turning ciphertext into readable plaintext. Ciphertext is not to be confused with codetext because the latter is a result of a code, not a cipher.</p>", "The_DAO_(organization)": "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Christoph_Jentzsch.jpg/320px-Christoph_Jentzsch.jpg\" alt=\"Wikipedia thumbnail\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px;\"><p><b>The DAO</b> was a digital decentralized autonomous organization and a form of investor-directed venture capital fund.

They are the most widely used of the country codes published by ISO, and are used most prominently for the Internet's country code top-level domains. They are also used as country identifiers extending the postal code when appropriate within the international postal system for paper mail, and have replaced the previous one consisting one-letter codes. They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its first edition in 1974.</p>", "Decentralized_application": "<p>A <b>decentralised application</b> is an application that can operate autonomously, typically through the use of smart contracts, that run on a decentralized computing, blockchain or other distributed ledger system. Like traditional applications, DApps provide some function or utility to its users. However, unlike traditional applications, DApps operate without human intervention and are not owned by any one entity, rather DApps distribute tokens that represent ownership. These tokens are distributed according to a programmed algorithm to the users of the system, diluting ownership and control of the DApp. Without any one entity controlling the system, the application is therefore decentralised.</p>", "SHA-2": "<p><b>SHA-2</b> is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001.
