The stakes of bakers and delegators are updated each pay day (but the changes for each pay day are fixed one epoch before). Pay day is thus when new bakers begin baking and updates to delegation and baking take effect, such as increasing stake, restaking preferences, adding delegation. In the case of decreasing stake or removing delegation or baking, there is a longer cool-down period, after which the change is executed at the <strong>next pay day after the cool-down period ends</strong>. The cool-down period is 2 weeks for delegators and 3 weeks for bakers. Pay day is every 24 hours (i.e., 24 epochs) at approximately 08:05 UTC on Mainnet and approximately 12:00 UTC on Testnet. Bakers are finalized at the end of the epoch before that next epoch where they are eligible to bake.</p></dd>", "a[href=\"../resources/glossary.html#term-Passive-delegation\"]": "<dt id=\"term-Passive-delegation\">Passive delegation</dt><dd><p>A form of delegation where a delegator\u2019s stake is effectively distributed among all baker pools.
