   *AesirX team*

In this edition of Developer Spotlight, we sit down with Ronni K. Gothard Christiansen, the founder of AesirX, to explore how his company is leveraging Concordium to build a privacy-first Web3 ecosystem. With tools that bridge Web2 and Web3, AesirX is focused on empowering users with data ownership while helping businesses stay compliant through practical, decentralized technologies.

To begin, could you tell us about your background and how AesirX was founded?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
I’ve been living in Vietnam for about six years now. AesirX started as an outsourcing company here, and over time we’ve built a team of 19 people. One of the things I’m proud of is that most of our team members are also shareholders. That’s something that evolved during the pandemic — we realized the importance of shared responsibility and fairness.

Initially, we were focused on Web2 services, but as privacy regulations became more important, and Web3 matured, we shifted toward building our own solutions that could bridge both worlds — starting with privacy.

How is AesirX funded? Did you use a token sale or external capital?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
We didn’t use token sales to fund development. AesirX has been primarily funded by me personally, and we have around 30 active investors, including business angels and partners. Now, we’re looking for major VC investment, but everything to date has been built using private capital.

You’re based in Vietnam. What advantages has that brought to the company?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
Vietnam is recognized as one of the most crypto-friendly countries globally. While estimates vary, it ranks second in global crypto adoption, reflecting a strong grassroots interest in digital assets.

The government is working on crypto-related regulation, which is expected soon. There’s also a strong push to tax digital marketplaces like Shopee to increase transparency and reduce corruption. For us, this creates a very pragmatic environment to build privacy and digital economy tools.

Let’s talk about your `Consent Management Platform <https://aesirx.io/solutions/consent-management-platform>`_. What sets it apart from other CMPs?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
A lot of CMPs today only deal with cookies. But privacy is much broader than that. Our first-party hosted CMP is compliant with the ePrivacy Directive 5 and designed to go beyond the standard cookie banners. It supports various global regulations and uses decentralized consent — stored in the user’s own digital wallet.

We also offer a clear and transparent pricing model. There are no hidden costs per impression or complex licensing. It’s meant to be straightforward and scalable.

You also offer a `Privacy Scanner <https://privacyscanner.aesirx.io/>`_ and `AI Assistant <https://aesirx.io/privacy-advisor-ai>`_. What are they used for?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
Our Privacy Scanner is based on a tool originally created by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), but we’ve expanded it to go deeper. It doesn’t just look at cookie usage — it analyzes the actual code, pixel trackers, and payloads to detect privacy risks that often go unnoticed.

We pair that with an AI-powered advisor, which helps businesses understand how to improve their compliance. A lot of companies think they’re compliant when they’re actually not. We’re trying to close that gap.

What is included in your `decentralized application <https://dapp.shield.aesirx.io/>`_ (dApp), and how does it work?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
Our dApp integrates multiple tools:

- Decentralized consent management
- Single Sign-On (SSO) using blockchain, which helps prevent brute-force attacks — especially for platforms like WordPress
- Shield of Privacy, which uses indirect Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to verify things like age and location without revealing sensitive data (*already in use on platforms such as* `concordium.com <https://concordium.com>`__)

*Editor's note: This integration with Concordium demonstrates how AesirX leverages the* `ID Layer <https://docs.concordium.com/en/mainnet/docs/network/web3-id/index.html>`_ *to enable privacy-preserving verification.*

- A creator verification system using blockchain-based identity
- Planned tools like interest-based pre-marketing

It’s all part of a single portal that brings Web3 infrastructure to real business needs in a user-friendly way.

How do you approach bridging Web2 and Web3 practically?
--------------------------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
We always start with solving real-world business problems — mostly in the Web2 space — and then enhance those solutions with Web3 technology. For example, we integrated blockchain-based SSO for WordPress. That immediately solves a problem (brute-force logins), while also introducing secure digital identity.

The goal is to make Web3 easy to use — so that anyone can benefit, not just those deeply involved in crypto.

Let’s move on to the $AESIRX token. What is its purpose, and when will it launch?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
The $AESIRX token is a utility token designed to support several incentive models:

- Contribute to Earn
- Share to Earn
- Affiliate/Reseller rewards

We’re planning a total supply of 100 million tokens, and we’re targeting a minimum value of $0.50 per token. This is a strategic goal to ensure that token-based incentives remain meaningful.

We’re not selling tokens directly. Instead, we offer partnerships, and bonus tokens may be included as part of those agreements. The focus is on growing a sustainable ecosystem, not speculation. The token will launch as multi-chain, and we are committed to ensuring regulatory compliance in markets like the U.S. before any public release.

You’re also building an NFT marketplace for software licenses — how will that work?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
We’re developing a platform where software licenses can be minted and resold as NFTs. This creates a secondary market for licenses and lets users retain value when they no longer need a license. These NFTs are based on the `CIS-2 <https://proposals.concordium.com/CIS/cis-2.html>`_ standard developed by Concordium, ensuring secure and identity-compliant transactions.

In this case, NFTs aren’t about digital art — they’re about transparent, verifiable ownership and transfer of software access.

What is the long-term vision for AesirX?
----------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
Our vision is to give users control over their data and reduce the growing problem of “consent fatigue.” That means simplifying consent flows, automating compliance, and embedding privacy into the user experience.

We want to mainstream decentralized data ownership, make it simple enough for non-technical users, and build systems where businesses can comply with laws effortlessly.

You mentioned that many businesses believe they’re compliant but aren’t. How does AesirX address that gap?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
That’s a real issue. Most businesses don’t knowingly violate privacy rules — they just don’t have the tools or knowledge to stay compliant. Our products — the Privacy Scanner, CMP, and AI Advisor — are designed to make compliance easy, accessible, and proactive.

Where does the name “AesirX” come from?
---------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
It’s a combination of Æsir, the family of gods in Norse mythology, and the rune “X”, which represents necessity. Privacy isn’t a luxury anymore — it’s a necessity. That’s the principle behind everything we do.

What’s on the `roadmap <https://aesirx.io/roadmap>`_ for the rest of the year?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ronni:**
We’re focused on:

- Launching the $AESIRX token in a compliant, multi-chain format
- Deploying the NFT license marketplace
- Enhancing onboarding tools for wallets and decentralized IDs
- Scaling adoption of our CMP and dApp
- Continuing to push for mainstream adoption of decentralized privacy infrastructure

We’re also working closely with legal and technical partners to ensure everything is sustainable and regulation-friendly from day one.

Final Thoughts
--------------

AesirX is creating a compelling privacy ecosystem — not by talking theory, but by building tools that work today. With a strong ethical foundation, real-world use cases, and an unwavering focus on decentralization done right, Ronni K. Gothard Christiansen and his team are shaping the future of responsible Web3 powered by Concordium.
