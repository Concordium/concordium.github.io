==================
Scheduled releases
==================

Some transfers contain a release schedule. This means that the CCD in the transfer can be seen on the account, but they are locked until one or more specific points in time. While the funds are locked, they cannot be transferred, but they will be part of the total amount on the account. Scheduled releases can only be created in the Desktop Wallet. You can inspect when funds will be released in Desktop Wallet, |mw-gen2|, and |mw-gen1|.
