The first cap bounds the size of a pool with respect to a fraction of all stake in pools (i.e., excluding passive delegation). For example, with the capital bound cap a pool cannot have more than 5% of all the stake in staking pools. This limit ensures that the pools remain distributed and prevents the crash of one validator from affecting the whole system. A party with lots of capital can run multiple validators to avoid this cap. This would increase decentralization.</p><p>The second cap is on the amount of stake in a pool with respect to the stake of the validator. For example, the total stake of a pool can be at most 6 times the stake of the validator. This bound is for security reasons as it prevents a party with a small stake from controlling too large a part of the system. Every validator\u2019s power is thus still proportional to their own stake, which is crucial for cryptographic security to hold.</p>", "a[href=\"#validator-details\"]": "<h2 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\">Validator details<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#validator-details\" title=\"Link to this heading\">#</a></h2><p>When you click a validator ID, the following appears:</p>", "a[href=\"ccd-scan-transactions.html#home-screen-transaction\"]": "<h2 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\">Transaction details<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#transaction-details\" title=\"Link to this heading\">#</a></h2><p>When you click a transaction hash, transaction information appears.
