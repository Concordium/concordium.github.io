Validators are rewarded for every block that they create with a payment of some <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../resources/glossary.html#term-CCD\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">CCD</span></a>. Because Concordium runs a proof-of-stake protocol, each validator needs to <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../resources/glossary.html#term-Staked-Amount\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">stake an amount to produce blocks</span></a>, and the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../resources/glossary.html#term-Lottery-Power\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">probability of being selected to create the next block</span></a> is proportional to each validator\u2019s stake.

Any party with CCD may delegate some of their capital to a validator. This increases the validator\u2019s chance of producing the next block and getting rewards, which are then shared with the delegators. This is a non-custodial solution: when a party delegates an amount of CCD to a validator, the CCDs are not transferred to the validator and remain under the party\u2019s control; they are just considered part of the validator\u2019s stake for the proof-of-stake protocol. Staked CCDs, both for delegators and validators, cannot be spent while staked.
