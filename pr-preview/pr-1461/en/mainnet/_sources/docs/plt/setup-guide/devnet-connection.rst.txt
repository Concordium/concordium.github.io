Connect to DevNet
=================

This guide explains how to configure your DevNet Browser Wallet to connect to Concordium's DevNet.

Before you begin
================

.. note::
   To connect to DevNet, you must first have an account on Testnet. This is because the Custom Network option in the wallet only becomes available after you have created at least one account on Testnet. If you don't already have a Testnet account, please `create one following the standard Concordium wallet setup process <https://developer.concordium.software/en/mainnet/net/browser-wallet/setup-browser-wallet.html>`_ before continuing with this guide.

Connect to DevNet

Follow these steps to configure your wallet to connect to DevNet:

1. Open the wallet extension in your browser and click on the menu button
