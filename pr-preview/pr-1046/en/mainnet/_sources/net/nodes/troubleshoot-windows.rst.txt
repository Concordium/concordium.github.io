Troubleshoot a node running on Windows
======================================

This guide describes how to troubleshoot a node running on Windows on the Concordium network.

Event viewer
============

Use the Event viewer to get more information about the problem. In the **Search** bar, search for **Event viewer**. In the **Windows Logs** click **Application**. Use the warnings and errors to diagnose the issue.

Node crash or database corruption
=================================

A node crash or database corruption is the problem if:

- the node fails to start
- the node is in a restart loop with an error message about database corruption
- or you get a "too few bytes" message.

The solution is to delete the relevant portion of the database.

The database directory should contain matching pairs of ``blockstate-$i.dat`` and ``treestate-$i`` files for some number of consecutive i's starting at 0. The number of the files differs depending on which protocol version is current.

.. code-block:: console

   accountmap
   blockstate-0.dat
   blockstate-1.dat
   blockstate-2.dat
   treestate-0
   treestate-1
   treestate-2

To resolve a crash or non-starting node, delete files, starting at the largest ``i``, until the node starts or until there are no more files in the directory.

- If only one of ``treestate-i`` or ``blockstate-$i.dat`` files exists, delete the other and try starting the node.
- Otherwise delete both files of the ``treestate-$i`` and ``blockstate-$i.dat`` pair and try starting the node.
