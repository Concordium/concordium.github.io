=====================
Web3 ID in the |bw|
=====================

Web3 verifiable credentials are available in the |bw|.

Add credentials to the wallet
=============================

When choosing to add verifiable credentials from an issuer, make sure that you *trust* the issuer.

#. Contact the issuer of the credentials and provide the information requested by the issuer.

#. The issuer sends a request to your |bw| to issue a verifiable credential. If you decline the request, the process stops here. If you accept the request, a public key is sent from your wallet to the issuer so that the issuer can put the credential on chain.



Revoke credentials from the wallet
==================================

In some cases, the issuer of the verifiable credential may allow you to revoke a credential yourself in your |bw| if you no longer need it.

#. Click on the verifiable credential to remove in the |bw|.

#. Click ? and select Revoke.

Recover credentials
