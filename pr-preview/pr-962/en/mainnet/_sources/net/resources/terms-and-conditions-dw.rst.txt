At `developer.concordium.software <https://developer.concordium.software>`_, you can read about how the wallet works. Concordium
Software may continually change and/or adjust the functions of Concordium Desktop Wallet. Concordium Software’s terms and conditions apply
to Concordium Desktop Wallet users worldwide.

The wallet will register and use data about you. Concordium Software will not register or use data about you.


Terms and conditions for all services and functions
===================================================

Parties to the agreement
------------------------

When you register with Concordium Desktop Wallet, you enter into an agreement with:

Concordium Software ApS, Østergade 13, 2., 1100 København K, Denmark. CVR no.: 42334758. Our email address is contact@concordium.software.

What you need in order to register with Concordium Desktop Wallet
=================================================================

The following is required to register with Concordium Desktop Wallet:

-  A computer with a newer version of Windows 10, macOS, or a Linux distribution like Ubuntu or Debian.

-  An identity that is verified with an identity provider and an initial account created on your behalf by the identity provider.
   The identity provider will know your identity and your ownership of an initial account.

-  A Ledger Nano S or Ledger Nano S Plus.

-  Concordium Ledger App.

You must be at least 18 years old to register.


Registering as a Concordium Desktop Wallet user
===============================================

To be able to use the Concordium Desktop Wallet, you need a Ledger Nano S or Nano S Plus hardware device with the Concordium Ledger Application installed.

Before you can use Concordium Desktop Wallet, you will need to create an initial account and register with an identity provider by following the
instructions in the app. An identity provider is a third-party supplier and independent of Concordium Software. The Concordium Desktop Wallet stores
data from the identity provider, but Concordium Software does not, and Concordium Software does not have access to data stored by the Concordium Desktop Wallet.

After you have created the initial account and registered with an identity provider, you can create additional accounts (‘regular accounts’) with which you will be able to carry out transactions.

Please note that you can only register one account as the initial account.


Activation code and personal password
=====================================

When you register in Concordium Desktop Wallet, you will need to create a personal password. You should be aware that the password can be used to
log on to Concordium Desktop Wallet and use some of the functions. All transactions require you to use the Ledger device with the Desktop Wallet to sign the transaction.

When you set up the Ledger device you’ll generate private keys on the Ledger device, and you’ll receive a 24-word recovery phrase that you must
store in a safe place. This is the only backup of your private keys.

Other obligations etc.
======================

You have a duty to ensure that the details you provide are correct and updated at any given time. Your Concordium Desktop Wallet and Ledger device are
personal and may be used only by you. You must not disclose your passwords and PIN codes to others, and you must not write them down, or save them on your
computer or mobile device. You must not disclose your Ledger device 24-word recovery phrase or PIN code to others or store them digitally on your computer or mobile device.

Concordium Desktop Wallet must not be used for illegal activities or purposes.

You must not use Concordium Desktop Wallet in a way that harasses other Concordium Desktop Wallet users.

All transaction requests are irreversible. You are yourself responsible for ensuring that the recipient of a transaction via Concordium Desktop Wallet is the
intended recipient, and you must verify that the transaction amount is correct. You are responsible for providing the correct account to persons and users who want to transfer funds to you.

To prevent unauthorized use of Concordium Desktop Wallet, you must store your computer and the Ledger device so that others cannot gain unauthorized access
to them. Do not disclose the password or PIN code to third parties.

You are obliged to verify your identity with an identity provider. The identity provider will know the identity of the initial account creator. Your identity
can be revealed via the process of anonymity revocation, which can happen under stringent regulations, such as a court order.

You are solely responsible for safekeeping your passwords, PINs, account keys, encryption keys, identity, Ledger recovery phrase, and any other codes you use
to access the Concordium Desktop Wallet or any information, CCD, or voucher. If you lose access to the Concordium Desktop Wallet, private keys, or identity,
and you have not separately stored a backup of your accounts and the corresponding password(s), you acknowledge and agree that any CCD you have associated with
that account will become inaccessible.
