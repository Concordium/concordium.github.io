Fractionalized NFT tutorial
===========================

in this tutorial you learn the necessary steps to fractionalize an NFT. The requirements for doing it are:

- The original NFT should be locked in a contract. The idea here is that when you create fractions, it should be limited. It has no point for an investor if infinitely new fractions minting/increasing the supply would be possible because that would reduce your share each time.

- NFT owners should be able to lock their assets and get semi-fungible tokens.
