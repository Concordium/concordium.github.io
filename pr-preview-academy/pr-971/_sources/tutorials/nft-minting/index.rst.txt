==================================
NFT minting tutorial with Rust-SDK
==================================

In this tutorial you will interact with a CIS-2 token contract for minting an NFT using the `Concordium Rust-SDK <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-sdk>`_. You will deploy and initialize the contract using the SDK and similarly invoke functions like ``mint()``, ``transfer()``, and ``tokenMetadata()`` using it. Since this is an SDK-oriented tutorial, there will not be any specific explanation about smart contract development. You can find many other examples that show how you can interact with Concordium using the Rust-SDK in `this example GitHub repository <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-sdk/tree/main/examples>`_. You will use the `Concordium Smart Contracts VSCode Extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Concordium.concordium-smart-contracts>`_ to create your template contract.
