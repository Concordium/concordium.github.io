NFT minting with ID 2.0
=======================

In this tutorial,you'll learn how to create a minting platform that allows minting for people older than 18. In order to do that, the platform should ask for proof that the minter meets a requirement which is being older than 18 years old. The tutorial contains three parts:

- The first part includes a lot of cryptographic implementation and an explanation of the backend verifier.

- The second part is about the front-end development and Concordium communication using concordium-web-sdk including |bw| integration.

- And the last part is demonstration of the application, including how it works.
