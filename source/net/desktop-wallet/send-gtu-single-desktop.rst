Send GTU from an account
========================

This topic describes how you can send GTU from an account with only one signer and without a schedule. If you want to learn about sending GTU with a schedule, see :ref:`Create a single signer GTU transfer with a schedule <GTU-single-schedule-desktop>`.

#. Go to **Accounts** and select the relevant account.

#. Select **Send**.

#. Enter the amount of GTU that you want to send. If the amount you want to transfer including the transfer fee exceeds the amount in your account, you’ll see a message saying **Insufficient funds**. This means that there's not enough GTU in the account, and you’ll have to change the amount.

#. Select the recipient and select **Continue**.

#. There's a message saying **Waiting for device**. Connect the Ledger to the computer and enter your PIN on Ledger.

#. Press the right button to navigate to the **Concordium** app, and then press both buttons to open the app. The Ledger says **Concordium is ready**. Wait for the message in the Desktop Wallet saying **Ledger Nano S is ready** and select **Submit**.

#. Review the transaction on the Ledger and verify that the information matches the **Transaction details** in the Desktop Wallet. Navigate to the right and verify the sender address is correct. Continue navigating to the right and verify that the recipient address is correct.

#. Press both buttons to sign the transaction. In the Desktop Wallet, you can see that the transfer has been submitted to the chain. Select **Finish**.
