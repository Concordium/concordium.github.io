What is file sealing? What is timestamping?
===========================================

Seals are used to protect items that should not be tampered with.
You can prove an item's origin and integrity after it has been timestamped
on the blockchain. Timestamping is a blockchain-based verification and
fraud protection process that assures the authenticity of a document.
If you seal and timestamp a file, you can prove that it was in your possession
at the sealing time and the file has not been changed since then.
