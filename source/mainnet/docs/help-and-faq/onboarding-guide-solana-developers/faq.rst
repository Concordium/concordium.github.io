=========================
FAQ for Solana developers
=========================

The following Frequently Asked Questions about Concordium focuses on helping developers with a Solana background to understand the Concordium blockchain and its smart contract ecosystem.

Feel free to participate and add your questions to the `Concordium software support channels <https://support.concordium.software/>`_.

Concordium smart contracts
==========================

.. dropdown:: What are `Solana programs` called on Concordium?

    Programs are called smart contracts on Concordium.
    See the comparison :ref:`here<solana-programs>`.

.. dropdown::  What smart contract language is used on Concordium?

    Smart contracts are deployed as Wasm modules on the Concordium chain. Like Solana, Concordium uses Rust to write and compile smart conracts.
    Rust currently has the best support to write and compile your smart contract into a Wasm module that then can be deployed to the Concordium chain.

.. dropdown::  How can I start with the Rust smart contract language?

    Rust is a fast and memory-efficient
    language that is a popular smart contract language among different blockchain projects.
    There is plenty of literature to get started with Rust such as the
    `Rust language book <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>`_.
    You can find examples of smart contracts in the
    `Concordium Rust smart contract repo  <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples>`_.

.. dropdown::  Where can I find example smart contracts?

    You can find examples of smart contracts in the
    `Concordium Rust smart contract repo  <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples>`_.

.. dropdown::  Where can I find a smart contract reference library similar to the GitHub repo from `Solana Program Library`?

    You can find examples and standard implementations in the
    `Concordium Rust smart contract repo  <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples>`_.

    .. note::

        These contracts are not meant for production.
        They are used to illustrate how to use the standard library and the tooling Concordium provides.
        There is no claim that the logic of the contract is reasonable or safe.

.. dropdown::  Should I use V0 or V1 smart contracts?

    Version 1 smart contracts have many improvements and features added compared to Version 0 smart contracts.
    Hence, V1 smart contracts are recommended over V0 smart contracts if you start a new project.
    Mainnet continues supporting V0 smart contracts due to backward compatibility.

.. dropdown::  How can I write a smart contract?

    You can follow the chapter :ref:`writing a smart contract<piggy-bank-writing>` in the piggy bank tutorial.

.. dropdown::  How can I test a smart contract?

    You can follow the chapter :ref:`testing a smart contract<piggy-bank-testing>` in the piggy bank tutorial.

.. dropdown:: Is there something similar to Solana's `Anchor` framework for Concordium?

    Yes. The Concordium standard library crate `concordium-std <https://crates.io/crates/concordium-std>`_ provides a high-level interface for writing smart contracts in Rust.
    It includes convenient ways of working with the contract state, provides macros for exposing Rust functions as entrypoints, handles serialization, provides testing infrastructure, etc.
    Together with :ref:`cargo-concordium<build-contract>` it can be used to develop, test and build smart contracts.

    You can follow the chapter :ref:`writing a smart contract<piggy-bank-writing>` in the piggy bank tutorial to get started with using `concordium-std <https://crates.io/crates/concordium-std>`_.

.. dropdown:: How can I update account data?

    Smart contract code cannot write data to user accounts or other smart contract state.
    Smart contracts manipulate their own state and call entrypoints of other contracts.
    See :ref:`solana-overview` for the details.

.. dropdown:: Is there something similar to native programs in Concordium?

    No. Security-critical functionalities like cryptographic primitives, smart contract state management, etc. are implemented as Wasm host functions.
    The list of supported host functions is available in :ref:`host-functions`.

    Separating these functionalities to host functions instead of having them as special smart contracts helps to rule out some vulnerabilities related to substituting native program addresses by users.


.. dropdown:: Can I build tests that print a table of content structure (a layered output similar to mocha and chai tests)?

    Yes. You can use a similar pattern as shown below:

    .. code-block:: rust

        #[cfg(test)]
        mod tests {
            mod func_a {
                #[test]
                fn correct_params_correct_result(){...}
                #[test]
                fn invalid_params_invalid_result(){...}
            }
        }

    The test cases are printed as follows:

    .. code-block:: rust

        running 2 tests
        test tests::func_a::correct_params_correct_result ... ok
        test tests::func_a::invalid_params_invalid_result ... ok

.. dropdown::  How are `program addresses` represented on Concordium?

    In terms of naming, Concordium uses *contract* and *account* to refer
    to a similar Solana's *executable account* (programs) and *non-executable account*, respectively.
    Note, however that the correspondense is not precise.
    See the :ref:`overview of differences <solana-overview>` for more details.

    The word *address* refers to either an *account* address or a *contract* address on Concordium.
    Contract addresses on Concordium are represented by an index and a subindex as seen below.
    When invoking the ``init`` function, a new smart contract instance is
    deployed and assigned the next index number in sequential order.
    The subindex is currently not in use and is always 0. There are plans to give the subindex meaning in the future.

    You cannot send CCD to a contract address (or account address) before they have been deployed/initialized on the Concordium chain.

    .. code-block:: rust

        ContractAddress {
            index:    1234,
            subindex: 0,
        };

.. dropdown::  How are `wallet addresses` represented on Concordium?

    In terms of naming, Concordium uses *contract* and *account* to refer
    to a similar Solana's *executable account* (programs) and *non-executable account*, respectively.
    Note, however that the correspondense is not precise.
    See the :ref:`overview of differences <solana-overview>` for more details.

    The word *address* refers to either an *account* address or a *contract* address on Concordium.
    Accounts on the chain are identified via an account address, which is a 32-byte sequence.
    The address is usually displayed in Base58Check encoding with version byte 1.
    An example of such an address is 3ZFGxLtnUUSJGW2WqjMh1DDjxyq5rnytCwkSqxFTpsWSFdQnNn.

    On Concordium, *accounts* are deployed on-chain and their corresponding *account address* only exists from that point on.
    You cannot send CCD to an account address (or a smart contract address) before they have been deployed/initialized on the Concordium chain.
    When a smart contract tries to interact with an address that has not been deployed/initialized yet, the interaction fails.

.. dropdown::  Can I distinguish between contract and account addresses?

    Yes. You can distinguish between the different types of addresses
    in smart contracts on the Concordium chain.
    `Addresses <https://docs.rs/concordium-std/latest/concordium_std/enum.Address.html>`_
    are represented as an enum with two variants.

    .. code-block:: rust

        pub enum Address {
            Account(AccountAddress),
            Contract(ContractAddress),
        }

    Rust has a pattern matching that determines at runtime which
    variant of the enum Address is applicable, and then the appropriate code
    is executed. You can read more about `pattern matching  <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html>`_ in the
    Rust language book.

    For example, the below code prints out a different message depending on if the `sender`
    that invoked this smart contract function is a contract or an account.

    .. code-block:: rust

        match ctx.sender() {
            Address::Contract(contract_address) => { println!("This contract invoked the function: {:?}", contract_address) },
            Address::Account(account_address) => { println!("This account invoked the function: {:?}", account_address) },
        };

    Add the above pattern matching snippet to one of your Rust smart contract functions and write
    a test case that invokes that function. You can see the printout of the snippet
    by running the tests with the below command.

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo test -- --nocapture

.. dropdown::  How do I get the transaction sender address on Concordium?

    The ``ctx.invoker()`` variable refers to the original account address (no contract address)
    that started the transaction while ``ctx.sender()``
    refers to the immediate address (it could be an account
    or another contract address) that invokes the function entry point.
    A contract cannot start a transaction and that is why ``ctx.invoker()`` never returns a contract address.

.. dropdown::  How do I get the balance of the smart contract within the Rust code?

    ``host.self_balance()`` returns the current balance of the smart contract.
    Upon entry to a smart contract function, the balance that is returned is the sum of the
    balance of the contract at the time of the invocation and the amount that is being transferred to the contract.
    Additional documentation can be found in the `self_balance description <https://docs.rs/concordium-std/latest/concordium_std/struct.ExternHost.html#tymethod.self_balance>`_
    of the ``concordium-std`` crate.

.. dropdown::  How do I get the address of the smart contract within the Rust code?

    ``ctx.self_address()`` returns the address of the smart contract.
    Additional documentation can be found in the `self_address description <https://docs.rs/concordium-std/latest/concordium_std/struct.ExternContext.html#tymethod.self_address>`_ of the concordium standard crate.

.. dropdown::  Can I print values from the smart contract code or test cases?

    Yes. You can use

    .. code-block:: rust

        println!("Printing output of f: {}, and g: {}", f(1,2,3), g("hi"));

    or

    .. code-block:: rust

        println!("Printing debug value: {:?}", 12345);

    for printing to stdout and

    .. code-block:: rust

        eprintln!("Printing output of f: {}, and g: {}", f(1,2,3), g("hi"));

    or

    .. code-block:: rust

        eprintln!("Printing debug value: {:?}", 12345);

    for printing to stderr.

    Add one of the above lines of code to a Rust smart contract function or one of your test cases (Write
    a test case that invokes your Rust smart contract function if the printing statement is in the smart contract code).
    You can see the printout by running the tests with the below command.

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo test -- --nocapture


.. dropdown::  My transaction is rejected and I get an error code number. How can I interpret smart contract errors?

    Error codes come from the ``concordium-std`` crate or are thrown by the smart contract itself.

    **Concordium-std crate errors**

    An example of a ``concordium-std`` crate error is shown below:

    .. code-block:: console

        Error: Updating contract instance failed:
        'smash' in 'PiggyBank' at {"index":12345,"subindex":0} failed with code -2147483636.

    .. image:: ../../../tutorials/piggy-bank/images/pb_tutorial_21.png
            :width: 100 %

    You can find the meaning of common error codes in this `list <https://docs.rs/concordium-std/latest/concordium_std/#signalling-errors>`_.
    This error was thrown by the ``concordium-std`` crate. The error codes start from ``i32::MIN`` and go upwards.
    ``-2147483636`` corresponds to ``NotPayableError``. In contrast, error types of smart contracts start from ``-1`` and go downwards.

    **Smart contract errors**

    An example of a smart contract error is shown below:

    .. code-block:: console

        Error: Updating contract instance failed:
        'smash' in 'PiggyBank' at {"index":12345,"subindex":0} failed with code -1.

    .. image:: ../../../tutorials/piggy-bank/images/pb_tutorial_27.png
        :width: 100 %

    You can find the meaning of the piggy bank error codes in this :ref:`section<piggy-bank-smash-error>`.
    This error was thrown by the smart contract. The error codes start from ``-1`` and go downwards.
    ``-1`` is the first error code and corresponds to ``NotOwner``.
    In contrast, errors from the ``concordium-std`` crate start from ``i32::MIN`` and go upwards.

.. dropdown:: Is there a smart contract code linter?

    Yes. You can use the ``fmt`` and the ``cargo clippy`` linter tools as described in the `README <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts>`_.

.. dropdown:: Are tests executed in parallel or sequentially?

    Tests run in parallel by default with the following two commands

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo concordium test

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo test

    You can use the below command for consecutive execution of the tests.

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo test -- --test-threads=1

.. dropdown:: How can I provide the input parameters as a JSON object and get the output parameters in a human-readable format when using the `concordium-client`? What is a smart contract schema?

    A :ref:`smart contract schema<contract-schema>` is a description of how to represent
    bytes in a more structured representation. It is used by
    external tools (such as the ``concordium-client``) when displaying the return value of a receive
    function and for specifying the input parameters to a receive
    function using a structured representation, such as JSON.

    The smart contract function needs to define a ``parameter`` and a ``return_value``
    so that a schema can be generated for the input parameters and the output parameters, respectively.

    .. code-block:: rust
        :emphasize-lines: 4, 5

        #[receive(
            contract = "CIS2-wCCD",
            name = "balanceOf",
            parameter = "ContractBalanceOfQueryParams",
            return_value = "ContractBalanceOfQueryResponse"
        )]
        fn contract_balance_of(
            ctx: &ReceiveContext,
            host: &Host<StateImplementation>,
        ) -> ContractResult<ContractBalanceOfQueryResponse> { ... }


    The schema can either be embedded into the smart contract or generated
    as a separate file.

    **Option 1 (Schema embedded into a smart contract)**

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo concordium build --schema-embed

    The shorter version of the above command is as follows:

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo concordium build -e

    .. image:: ./images/onboarding_ethereum_developers_5.png
        :width: 100 %

    **Option 2 (Schema as a separate file)**

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo concordium build --schema-out ./schema.bin

    The shorter version of the above command is as follows:

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo concordium build -s ./schema.bin

    .. image:: ./images/onboarding_ethereum_developers_6.png
        :width: 100 %

    If the schema is a separate file, it needs to be provided with the ``--schema`` flag to the ``concordium-client``.

    When using the ``concordium-client`` to interact with smart contracts the input and output parameters
    can be either in human-readable format (with a schema) or in raw bytes (binary format).

    **Example 1 (Schema is provided as a separate file but the provided
    file with the flag `parameter-json` has a wrong JSON object)**

    If your JSON object that was provided with the ``--parameter-json`` flag is in the wrong format, you
    get an error message with additional information on what JSON object format is expected.
    This information can help you to create the correct JSON object.

    .. image:: ./images/onboarding_ethereum_developers_7.png
        :width: 100 %

    **Example 2 (Schema is embedded into the smart contract and the `parameter-json`
    flag provides the input parameters as a JSON object; the return value is displayed
    in a human-readable format due to the provided additional information in the schema)**

    .. image:: ./images/onboarding_ethereum_developers_8.png
        :width: 100 %

    **Example 3 (Schema is provided as a separate file and the `parameter-json` flag
    provides the input parameters as a JSON object; the return value is displayed in a
    human-readable format due to the provided additional information in the schema)**

    .. image:: ./images/onboarding_ethereum_developers_9.png
        :width: 100 %

    **Example 4 (No schema is provided and the `parameter-binary` flag provides the input
    parameters as a raw bytes string; the return value is displayed in raw bytes because no additional
    information is available on how to represent the bytes in a human-readable format)**

    .. image:: ./images/onboarding_ethereum_developers_10.png
        :width: 100 %

.. dropdown:: How can I create the parameter data if I want to use binary input instead of a JSON input?

    When using the ``concordium-client`` to interact with smart contracts the input and output parameters
    can be either in human-readable format (with a schema) or in raw bytes (binary format).
    If you want to use the binary format, the below command shows that a `myInputParameters.bin` file is required.

    .. code-block:: console

        $concordium-client contract update <ContractIndex> --entrypoint <ContractEntryPoint> --parameter-binary myInputParameters.bin --sender <Account> --energy 12345678

    You can create such a `myInputParameters.bin` file by adding the below lines to your test cases replacing the `ExampleParams` struct with your input parameter struct for that function.

    .. code-block:: rust

        let parameter = ExampleParams {
            example_key1: value1,
            example_key1: value2,
        }
        let parameter_bytes = to_bytes(&parameter);
        std::fs::write("myInputParameters.bin", &parameter_bytes).expect("Failed to write parameter file");

    When running the tests with the below command the `myInputParameters.bin` file is created in the current folder.

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo test

Events
======

.. dropdown::  Where can I find a logged event on testnet/mainnet?

    You can look up a transaction hash on the dashboard such as `this example <https://dashboard.testnet.concordium.com/lookup/13ded9aaf6085e970b2cf3874431de5805ffa35a553c93707d1863a8888e8aa4>`_.
    It will provide you with the full execution chain of the smart contracts that
    were invoked and updated during this transaction.
    You can click on an updated contract instance row to see additional information.
    For example, navigate to the last page (third page) of the displayed execution chain of `this transaction <https://dashboard.testnet.concordium.com/lookup/13ded9aaf6085e970b2cf3874431de5805ffa35a553c93707d1863a8888e8aa4>`_
    and click on the top row `Updated contract instance at address: <783,0>`. You will see additional information
    about the smart contract address, name, the function entry point that was invoked,
    the CCD amount that was sent to the function, and events that were logged by this smart contract function.

    The image below shows that one event was logged by the contract `<783,0>` and no event was logged by the contract `<782,0>`.

    .. image:: ./images/onboarding_ethereum_developers_1.png
        :width: 100 %

    If several events are logged by one function entry point, the different events can be distinguished by their array index.
    The image below shows that four events were logged by an entry point in
    `this execution chain <https://dashboard.testnet.concordium.com/lookup/7fcad417384d8e36fd2264d16d0ce1385860cdad711d17f7d6c12137c9cbab2e>`_.

    .. image:: ./images/onboarding_ethereum_developers_2.png
        :width: 100 %

.. dropdown::  How can I compare/decode the event data that I see on the dashboard?

    A smart contract developer is free to use their own way of encoding and
    interpreting event log data when writing their own smart contracts.

    The official Concordium smart contracts use the following standard:
    Each event has a number tag and then the rest of the event data.

    .. image:: ./images/onboarding_ethereum_developers_11.png
        :width: 100 %

    For example, the above image has an event number tag of ``fd`` (hex encoding) which is ``15*16+13 = 253`` in decimal.
    This number tag corresponds to a `burn event <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/blob/main/concordium-cis2/src/lib.rs#L53>`_
    of a `Cis2` token.
    ``u8::MAX`` is ``255`` in decimal and ``u8::MAX-2`` is ``253`` in decimal (the same value as in the image above).

    .. code-block:: rust

        pub const BURN_EVENT_TAG: u8 = u8::MAX - 2;

    This number tag is used to distinguish between the different types of events.

    **Option 1:**
    You can compare the rest of the event data by adding the below lines of code to your test cases
    and adjusting the `MyEventParams` to the event object that you are using.

    .. code-block:: rust

        let parameter = MyEventParams {
            example_key1: value1,
            example_key1: value2,
        }
        let parameter_bytes = to_bytes(&parameter);
        println!("{:02x?}", parameter_bytes);

    When running the test cases with the below command, the event data is printed to your standard output.

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo test -- --nocapture

    For example, the following output would be shown on
    `the dashboard <https://dashboard.testnet.concordium.com/lookup>`_ as  0: fe0003532a04.

    .. code-block:: console

        [fe, 00, 03, 53, 2a, 04]

    **Option 2:**
    You can compare the rest of the event data by adding the below line to your ``Cargo.toml`` file

    .. code-block:: rust

        [dependencies]
        hex = "0.4"

    as well as adding the below lines of code to your test cases
    and adjusting the `MyEventParams` to the event object that you are using.

    .. code-block:: rust

        let parameter = MyEventParams {
            example_key1: value1,
            example_key1: value2,
        }
        let parameter_bytes = to_bytes(&parameter);
        println!("{}", hex::encode(&parameter_bytes));

    When running the test cases with the below command, the event data is printed to your standard output.

    .. code-block:: console

        $cargo test -- --nocapture

    For example, the following output would be shown:

    .. code-block:: console

        fe0003532a04

.. dropdown::  How does the |Chain|_ record CCD transfer events in the test cases?

    Every time when a transfer occurs by the below code, the |Chain|_ records the `address` and the `amount`.

    .. code-block:: rust

        host.invoke_transfer(address, amount);

    The recorded event data can be used in the test cases to confirm that the CCD was
    transferred as shown in the below `example code <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/blob/main/examples/recorder/tests/tests.rs#L102>`_.

    .. code-block:: rust

        assert_eq!(update_transfer.account_transfers().collect::<Vec<_>>()[..], [
            (contract_address, Amount::zero(), ACC_0),
            (contract_address, Amount::zero(), ACC_1)
        ]);

Standards
=========

.. dropdown::  Is there something similar to the SPL Token Program?

    Yes, please read the `CIS-2 standard <https://proposals.concordium.software/CIS/cis-2.html>`_.
    The `CIS-2` standard can represent fungible and non-fungible tokens.
    Please explore the corresponding `CIS-2 library <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/blob/main/concordium-cis2/src/lib.rs>`_.
    The `CIS-2` library is meant to be imported by `CIS-2` tokens.
    Please explore the `CIS-2` token standard implementations that import the `CIS-2` library:

    .. include:: ../snippets/tokens.rst

.. dropdown::  Is there something similar to the Solana's wrapped token wSOL?

    Yes, please explore:

    - the :ref:`wCCD tutorial<wCCD>`
    - the wCCD example `source code <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/blob/main/examples/cis2-wccd/src/lib.rs>`_.

    Concordium provides and maintains the canonical wCCD implementation.
    Developers are encouraged to use the following addresses for their dApps.

    - Testnet canonical wCCD address: |wccd-address-testnet|
    - Mainnet canonical wCCD address: |wccd-address-mainnet|

.. dropdown:: Does Concordium have upgradable smart contracts?

    Yes, you can choose to make your smart contracts upgradable. See :ref:`contract-instance-upgradeability` for more details.

Deploying and initializing smart contracts
==========================================

.. dropdown::  How can I deploy a smart contract to the Concordium chain?

    You can follow the chapter :ref:`deploying a smart contract<piggy-bank-deploying>` in the piggy bank tutorial.

.. dropdown::  Is there a smart contract size limit when deploying a contract on-chain?

    Yes. The module (`.wasm` file) size limit is 64kB for V0 contracts and 512kB for V1 contracts.

.. dropdown::  What is the `owner` of a smart contract instance on Concordium?

    You can access the account that created a smart contract instance with the variable ``ctx.owner()``.
    It is always an account because smart contracts cannot initialize another smart contract on Concordium.
    ``ctx.owner()`` is the account that invoked the ``init`` function to create a smart contract instance.

.. dropdown::  Can a smart contract deploy/initialize another smart contract on Concordium?

    No. The ``init`` function has to be called by an account (not a smart contract) on the Concordium chain.

.. dropdown::  Can I predict/calculate the address of the smart contract before deploying it?

    No. Contract addresses on Concordium are represented by an index and a subindex as seen below.
    When invoking the ``init`` function, a new smart contract instance is
    deployed and assigned the next index number in sequential order.
    The subindex is currently not in use and is always 0. There are plans to give the subindex meaning in the future.

    In contrast to Solana, you cannot send CCD to a contract address (or account address) before they have been deployed/initialized.

    .. code-block:: rust

        ContractAddress {
            index:    1234,
            subindex: 0,
        };

.. dropdown::  Can I invoke another smart contract from within the `init` function?

    No. The ``init`` function is similar to a `constructor` function. Its purpose
    is to deploy a new smart contract instance from a module and set the state of the current smart contract.
    You have to use a regular ``receive`` function when you want to invoke another smart contract.

Concordium tools
================

.. dropdown::  Does Concordium have a block explorer?

    Yes. The official block explorer is `CCDScan <https://testnet.ccdscan.io/>`_.
    In addition, you can use the dashboard
    to `look up txs <https://dashboard.testnet.concordium.com/lookup>`_,
    `explore the network <https://dashboard.testnet.concordium.com>`_,
    and observe the `block-producing process <https://dashboard.testnet.concordium.com/chain>`_.

.. dropdown::  Can I upload and verify my smart contract code on the block explorer (CCDScan)?

    CCDScan currently does not support compiling, hosting, or verifying your smart contract code.
    You are welcome to publish your smart contract code in public source code management tools such as `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_.

Miscellaneous
=============

.. dropdown:: What is the native currency on Concordium?

    The native currency of the Concordium chain is CCD.

.. dropdown:: Where do I get some test CCD? Is there a testnet faucet?

    There are several options to request test CCD:

    **Option 1:**
    If you just created your account in the mobile app wallet, you
    find a button to request 2000 testnet CCD to get started with your new account.

        :width: 20 %
    .. image:: ../../../tutorials/piggy-bank/images/pb_tutorial_6.png
        :width: 20 %

    **Option 2:** If you have the curl package installed on your Unix-like operating systems,
    you can request CCD in the terminal directly from the wallet proxy via the below command.

    .. code-block:: console

        $curl -X PUT https://wallet-proxy.testnet.concordium.com/v0/testnetGTUDrop/<YourAccountAddress>

    If you insert your account address correctly, the command should look similar to the below line.

    .. code-block:: console

        $curl -X PUT https://wallet-proxy.testnet.concordium.com/v0/testnetGTUDrop/4phD1qaS3U1nLrzJcgYyiPq1k8aV1wAjTjYVPE3JXBDAz9WdEy

    The above request will return a transaction hash which you can look up on the block explorer.
    You can only request CCD a single time for each account address via this API endpoint.
    If you already submitted a request before, it will be an old transaction hash that is returned.

        :width: 100 %

    **Option 3:**
    Alternatively, you can use `Postman <https://www.postman.com/>`_ and insert the following data before clicking the `Send` button.

    .. image:: ./images/onboarding_ethereum_developers_4.png
        :width: 100 %

    **Option 4:**
    If you have the curl package and the ``concordium-client`` tool installed on your Unix-like operating systems, you can request CCD to any of your alias account addresses.
    If you already sent a previous request to the wallet proxy, you can not request any more CCD to the same account address.
    Look up one of your alias account addresses instead and use it for your request.
    The CCD will be credited to your canonical account address.

    .. code-block:: console

        $concordium-client account show-alias <YourAccountAddress> --alias <number>

    If you insert your account address and a number correctly, the command should look similar to the below line.

    .. code-block:: console

        $concordium-client account show-alias 4phD1qaS3U1nLrzJcgYyiPq1k8aV1wAjTjYVPE3JaqovViXS4j --alias 17

    This generates the output:

    .. code-block:: console

        The requested alias for address 4phD1qaS3U1nLrzJcgYyiPq1k8aV1wAjTjYVPE3JaqovViXS4j is 4phD1qaS3U1nLrzJcgYyiPq1k8aV1wAjTjYVPE3JXBDCpCaUT6

    Copy your alias address to the below command.

    .. code-block:: console

        $curl -X PUT https://wallet-proxy.testnet.concordium.com/v0/testnetGTUDrop/<YourAliasAccountAddress>

    If you insert your alias account address correctly, the command should look similar to the below line.

    .. code-block:: console

        $curl -X PUT https://wallet-proxy.testnet.concordium.com/v0/testnetGTUDrop/4phD1qaS3U1nLrzJcgYyiPq1k8aV1wAjTjYVPE3JXBDCpCaUT6

    **Option 5:** If you need plenty of CCD for large-scale testing,
    please contact Concordium’s technical support via support@concordium.software.

.. dropdown::  Is there something similar to transaction fees?

    Yes, transaction fees are called NRG (pronounced energy) on the Concordium chain.
    The block limit is 3 million NRG. Transaction fees are fixed in Euro and are currently set to 1 Eurocent for basic CCD transfers.
    Fixing transaction fees in Euro is a unique feature of Concordium that provides predictable transaction costs.

.. dropdown::  What networks can be used for testing?

    Concordium has a testnet and a stagenet for testing.
    The testnet is available publicly. Please contact us via Concordium’s technical support
    support@concordium.software if you have a special
    request for accessing other networks.

.. dropdown:: Does Concordium have multiSig wallets?

    Yes. You can create a `multiSig wallet <https://developer.concordium.software/en/mainnet/net/guides/overview-shared-accounts.html>`_ with the desktop wallet.
    Each account has 1+ credentials, and each credential has 1+ keys.
    You can set a threshold for the number of signers needed on an account (for example 2/3 signers).

    .. note::

        The desktop wallet supports all transaction types, except smart contract transactions.

    .. note::

        You cannot import the keys from the desktop wallet to the ``concordium-client``.
        Hence, the desktop wallet does not support smart contract transactions.
        If you need the multiSig wallet to manage a smart contract,
        you need to deploy a smart contract multiSig wallet.

.. dropdown::  What does `invoke` mean?

    - It can mean to execute or initiate a function. It is equivalent to Solana saying: "Calling a program".

    - In the context of the ``concordium-client`` tool, it means to simulate a transaction locally on your node via the `invoke` command of the ``concordium-client`` tool instead of sending the transaction to the blockchain network and executing it on-chain. Since the transaction was simulated it was not inserted by the bakers in a block and is not part of the blockchain and state changes that the `invoke` command makes are discarded afterwards.
