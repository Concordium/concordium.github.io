Create an account
=================

Desktop Wallet users: When you created your :term:`identity`, it came with an :term:`initial account`. The initial account is a special account that the :term:`identity provider` submits
to the chain. When you already have an identity, you can create more :term:`accounts<account>` with that identity yourself.

|bw| and |cryptox| users: No initial account was created when you created your :term:`identity`. You create all :term:`accounts<account>` related to your identities.

To learn more about identities and accounts, see :ref:`Identities <reference-id-accounts>` and :ref:`Accounts <managing_accounts>`.
