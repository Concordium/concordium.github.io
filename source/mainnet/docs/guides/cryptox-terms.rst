10. Risks
=========

The App is developed using and made available on blockchain technology. As this is an emerging technology, it is subject to additional risks. By using the App, you explicitly acknowledge and accept all such risks. You should note that this is not an exhaustive list of all the risks associated with digital assets.

10.1 No custody
---------------

The App is self-custodial in nature on your device. As such, you are solely responsible for the safeguarding, retention and security of your seed phrase, private keys, password, and your device. Your seed phrase is the master key that allows you to access your digital assets. If you lose your seed phrase, you may not be able to access your digital assets. Do not share your seed phrase, private keys, or password with anyone. Anyone who knows your seed phrase will be able to access and transfer your digital assets. You acknowledge that we do not store and are not responsible in any way for the safeguarding, retention, security or recovery of your seed phrase, private keys, or password. You agree to release us from any liability for and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand arising from or in connection with the loss of your seed phrase, private keys, or password.

10.2. No Advice / No Reliance
-----------------------------

10.2.1. All information visible on the App or in connection with your use of the App is for informational purposes only. The App is not intended as, and does not provide, any investment or financial advice. With respect to any financial or investment decisions, we recommend you conduct your own research to properly evaluate the risks and benefits of any transaction. We recommend you seek the advice and guidance of qualified accountants, financial advisors, tax advisors, legal counsel, and investment advisors, in connection with any investment or financial transaction. You agree to be held fully responsible for your decisions.

10.2.2. None of the information visible on the App when the App is connected to any blockchain or decentralized application or protocol, including without limitation any bid, offer, price, quantity, volume, depth, or other data, represents an offer or a solicitation of an offer to enter into a transaction with us or an offer by us to enter into any transaction on your behalf.

10.2.3 You warrant that you have sufficient knowledge, sophistication, professional advice and technical and investing experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction entered into through the App or any underlying digital asset. You should not use the App or use or transact in digital assets unless you fully understand the nature of the transaction you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss. We are not responsible for any loss you may incur as a result of a decrease in the value of your digital assets, including without limitation, in connection with the lack of availability or degraded performance of the App.

10.3. Digital Asset Volatility and Characteristics
--------------------------------------------------

10.3.1. Using, buying, holding, and selling digital assets involve certain risks of financial loss. Any digital asset may be subject to fluctuations in value, including a total loss of value. The volatility and unpredictability of the price of digital assets relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time. The nature of digital assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack. You acknowledge these risks and agree that we cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or loss of value.

10.3.2. Digital assets and their underlying blockchain networks are complex emerging technologies that are typically globally distributed across multiple, unaffiliated nodes. They may experience delays, halts or go offline as a result of errors, forks, attacks, or other unforeseeable reasons. They are also subject to speculative interest and regulatory attention, which may contribute to price volatility and liquidity constraints. The compatibility of a digital asset or with Third Party Services on the App does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the digital asset or its underlying technology and should not be treated as a substitute for your own understanding of the risks specific to each digital asset. We provide no warranty as to the suitability of any digital assets or Third-Party Services and assume no fiduciary duty to you in connection with your use of the App.

10.3.3. All digital asset transactions are irreversible. You accept all consequences of using or transacting digital assets. Once you send digital assets to an address, you accept the risk that you may permanently lose access to it. You assume all liability for any losses incurred as a result of your transactions or transfers of digital assets. You are solely liable for verifying the accuracy of any external wallet address and the identity of the recipient. We do not control any blockchain network and cannot guarantee that any transfer will be confirmed or transferred successfully by the network. We are not responsible for any losses or for taking any actions to attempt to recover any lost, stolen, misdirected or irrecoverable digital assets.

10.4. Technical and Operational Risks
-------------------------------------

10.4.1. The technology underlying digital assets, including without limitation applied cryptography, blockchain, networking and distributed systems, and smart contracts, is subject to change at any time. Such changes may affect the App. You assume full responsibility for monitoring such technological changes and understanding their impact on your digital assets.

10.4.2. The digital assets and their underlying networks are under development and continue to evolve. As such, they may be subject to material and sudden changes that may have a significant impact on the availability, usability, or value of a particular digital asset. In addition, as a general matter, the operations, functionalities, development and distributions of digital assets and their underlying networks are beyond our control. You agree not to hold us liable for any related losses.

10.4.3. Blockchain networks are susceptible to various attacks such as an attack in which an attacker gains control of a requisite mining or validating power on the network. We cannot prevent or mitigate attacks on blockchain networks and has no obligation to engage in activity in relation to such attacks.

10.4.4. We cannot guarantee the App will be available at all times. The App may include coding errors or other errors.

10.5 Tax and Compliance
-----------------------

10.5.1. Digital assets may be subject to taxation. It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct using the App, and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.

10.5.2 You are responsible for complying with all applicable laws. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether or which laws and regulations may apply to your activities or transactions.

10.6. Legislative and Regulatory Risks
--------------------------------------

Digital assets and any software or service related to digital assets are subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions. As such, legislative and regulatory changes or actions may adversely affect the usage, transferability, transactability and value of digital assets, or your access to, and our ability make the App available. You acknowledge and accept the risks that such changes may bring and that we are not liable for any resulting adverse impact to you.

11. Data privacy
================

11.1. To collect information about the usage of the App, while preserving as much user privacy as possible, we use cookie-less tracking in the App. We use this information to administer the App and we analyse this information to improve and enhance the App by expanding its features and functionality and tailoring it to our users’ needs and preferences. This includes tracking of App versions.

11.2. When you create a Concordium Digital Identity Certificate (**“Identity Certificate”**) with a Third-Party Service, you will enter an agreement directly with such Third-Party Service and such Third-Party Service will store data about you. In this case, the Third-Party Service’s privacy policy and terms of use apply. The Third-Party Service may store a copy of the Identity Certificate for subsequent re-issuance; however, the Third-Party Service will not have access to your blockchain account address. The App stores the Identity Certificate in encrypted form, and it is not visible to us. You may choose to reveal and make publicly available any attributes associated with your account. However, if you reveal such attributes, these attributes will be visible on the blockchain, and can never be deleted.

11.3. When you use  Remote Procedure Call (“RPC”) provider in the App to interact with a blockchain, certain information about you is collected. Depending on the RPC provider you use, your IP address and your blockchain account address when you send a transaction may be collected and your account address will be broadcasted to the Concordium blockchain.

12. Governing law
=================

These Terms are governed by Swiss law. Any disputes arising under or in connection with these Terms, your use of the App is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the city of Zurich.

13. Miscellaneous
=================

These Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the App or in respect to the App constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us in relation to the App. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms or use of the App. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defences you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms.
