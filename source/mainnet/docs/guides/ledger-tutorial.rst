How To Use Your Ledger Device With Concordium Desktop Wallet

Ledger uses an offline, or cold storage, method of generating private keys, making it a preferred method for many crypto users. This guide will help you to connect your Ledger device to the Concordium Desktop Wallet. The Concordium Desktop Wallet enables you to Send and Receive CCD with the Ledger Device.
