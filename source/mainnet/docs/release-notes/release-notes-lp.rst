            - Changing restake preference is no longer blocked when the validator is below minimum stake threshold.
            - `SendTransaction` in wallet-api now supports `bigint` as part of smart contract parameters, fixing an issue with using large numbers.
            - Users can view their secret recovery phrase in the wallet settings if they need to write it down again.
            - Fixed a crash when the value in stake field was larger than a 64 bit integer when updating the stake.
            - Fixed an issue that would potentially block the wallet from loading or cause a crash if a third-party app blocked extensions.

        .. dropdown:: |bw| 1.3.0 - January 10, 2024

            The EUROe token is now added to all accounts by default.

        .. dropdown:: |bw| 1.2.1 - November 21, 2023

            |bw| 1.2.1 implements the renaming of bakers to validators throughout the wallet. The other changes related to Concordium's tokenomics updates have also been applied.

        .. dropdown:: |bw| 1.1.11 - November 9, 2023

            |bw| 1.1.11 removes the use of the gRPC v1 API and JSON-RPC. It also supports changes made to the web-sdk, and it supports editing of commissions in staking pools in accordance with the upcoming tokenomics changes.

        .. dropdown:: |bw| 1.1.8 - September 12, 2023

            |bw| 1.1.8 contains a simple page for Web3 ID age proofs.

        .. dropdown:: |bw| 1.1.7 - September 11, 2023

            |bw| 1.1.7 introduces support for Web3 ID. Web3 ID is an extension of the core protocol identity with other types of credentials that don’t have stringent requirements on anonymity revocation, but can also witness a number of other attributes of the holder. Examples of this would be club membership credentials, reward programs, etc. There are no requirements imposed on who can be an issuer of these credentials, and in contrast to protocol identities, the Web3 ID credentials can be revoked according to the logic imposed by the issuer.

            For wallet users, you can already use the Web3 ID functionality by using the `Concordia social media verifier on Mainnet <https://concordia.mainnet.concordium.software/>`_ or `Concordia social media verifier on Testnet <https://concordia.testnet.concordium.com/>`_. With Concordia, you can prove ownership of accounts on Telegram and Discord and thus transfer trust between the two platforms. Using the bots to issue credentials based on your Telegram and Discord logins allows you to link your accounts and optionally your real name. This is done in two steps. First, you get Web3 ID credentials for your accounts (e.g. one for Discord, one for Telegram). Then, a dApp checks the credentials and stores the verification. Other users can see your other linked accounts within the platform, transferring trust since they know you from another platform.

        .. dropdown:: |bw| 1.0.7 - August 17, 2023

            |bw| 1.0.7 adds support for the `protocol version 6 <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals/blob/main/updates/P6.txt>`_ with ConcordiumBFT consensus which will be released August 21, 2023.

            Additionally, Concordium plans to remove support for JSON-RPC in the |bw| on 1 November 2023. JSON-RPC allows a dApp to communicate with the same node as the wallet is connected to, and enables dApps to access the JSON-RPC interface without being connected to a separate server itself. In future, the wallet API will only use gRPC2. More information is forthcoming about how developers should prepare for this.

        .. dropdown:: |bw| 1.0.6 - May 30, 2023

            |bw| 1.0.6 contains fixes for the following issues:

            - The About page link to the terms and conditions pointed to the wrong URL. It now uses the value retrieved from the wallet proxy, or the correct default to the unified terms and conditions page.

            - Fixed an empty recovery displaying an error instead of informing the user that nothing was found.

            - Fixed an issue where the transaction list view would show the Request CCD button while loading the initial batch of transactions.

            - Fixed an issue so the first call of the gRPC client no longer always fails.

            - Fixed an issue so the first call of the gRPC client after changing network uses the correct network.

            - Added a missing translation for the Request CCD button.

            - ``deployModule`` transactions are now supported in the ``sendTransaction`` endpoint of the wallet-api.

            - In the display of a `deployModule` transaction, the previously titled module hash is now titled module reference.

            - Display of a `deployModule` transaction includes a copy button for the module reference.

            - Updated web-sdk to fix incorrect estimated cost for `deployModule` transaction.

            - Added text that a transaction has been submitted.

            - Messages when confirming baker/delegation transactions no longer appear after the transaction has been submitted.

            - gRPC-web is now used instead of json-RPC.

            - The initial view in the manage token flow now retains the token page header, doesn't collapse account balances, and the error messages for looking up a contract have been improved.

            - Fixed handling of UpdateAccountKey transactions from wallet-proxy.

            - Fixed `chainChanged` event to correctly propagate to all (not just whitelisted) dapps listening for events through the wallet API.

            - When changing the selected chain internally in the wallet, dapps now receive `accountChanged` event if an account on the new network has the dApp whitelisted, or `accountDisconnected` event if no account on the new network has the dApp whitelisted.

            - SendTransaction now validates that an account has sufficient funds before sending a transaction (requested though the API).

            - Added support for eID identity document types.

            - Improved readability of events in transaction details.

            - In the manage page for adding CIS-2 tokens, the contract index is now always initially empty.

            - Incorrect navigation flow on the "earn" page when switching between accounts.

            - Issues with the expansion of the account balance details view when navigating through different flows.

            - Recovery no longer assigns duplicate names to identities when new identities are visited earlier than existing ones during the recovery process.

            - AddCIS2Tokens through API now adds tokens to the given account, instead of the currently selected one.

            - Missing translations for some identity attributes.

            - Removed double unit on CCD in token overview.

            - A bug that caused an identity to not be recovered if there was a rejected one present in the same index.

        .. dropdown:: |bw| 0.9.11 - March 29, 2023

            - Corrected an issue where incorrect CIS-2 token metadata URL serialization for tokens with checksums caused those to be unable to be added.
            - Init contract transaction now displays as "Contract initialization".
            - Update contract transaction now displays as "Contract update".
            - addCIS2Tokens now returns the list of added tokens without an internal wrapper.

        .. dropdown:: |bw| 0.9.6 - January 9, 2023

        .. dropdown:: |bw| 0.9.4 - December 16, 2022

            The |bw| introduces ID2.0 functionality whereby a dApp or service can use zero knowledge proofs to request proof from a wallet for certain attributes without revealing anything beyond the truth of the statement. It is also possible for a dApp or Service to request that the wallet user reveal attributes.

        .. dropdown:: |bw| 0.8.5 - December 6, 2022

            The |bw| now includes support to manage fungible and non-fungible tokens. This includes adding, inspecting, and removing tokens.

Nodes
=====

Mainnet
-------

    March 3, 2025

    Concordium node version 8.0.3 contains support for `protocol version 8 <https://proposals.concordium.software/updates/P8.html>`_.
    The new consensus protocol will take effect on the mainnet on March 17, 2025.
    **Node runners should upgrade to version 8.0.3 before the protocol update to ensure that their nodes do not shut down.**
    Validators in particular are encouraged to update their nodes, as the new protocol introduces suspension of inactive validators, meaning that failing to update may result in your validator being suspended.

    Protocol version 8 introduces the following changes:

        - Validators are automatically suspended if they do not produce blocks for a certain number of rounds.

        - The configure-validator transaction can suspend or resume a validator, including adding a validator in a suspended state.

        - Suspended validators are paused from participating in the consensus algorithm.

    Additionally, the node release includes a number of fixes and improvements:

        - Add suspension info to `BakerPoolStatus` / `CurrentPaydayBakerPoolStatus` query results.

        - Add `GetConsensusDetailedStatus` gRPC endpoint for getting detailed information on the status of the consensus, at consensus version 1.

        - Update Rust version to 1.82.

        - Update GHC version to 9.6.6 (LTS-22.39).

        - Add `GetScheduledReleaseAccounts` endpoint for querying the list of accounts that have scheduled releases.

        - Add `GetCooldownAccounts`, `GetPreCooldownAccounts` and `GetPrePreCooldownAccounts` endpoints for querying the lists of accounts that have pending cooldowns in protocol version 7 onwards.

        - gRPC endpoints `DryRun`, `GetBlockItemStatus` and `GetBlockTransactionEvents` now report the parameter used to initialize a smart contract instance as part of a `ContractInitializedEvent`.

        - Fix a bug where, after a protocol update in consensus version 1 (P6 onwards), a node may miscalculate the absolute height of blocks when it is restarted.

        - Fix a bug where `GetBlockInfo` reports the parent block of a genesis block to be the last finalized block of the previous genesis index, instead of the terminal block.

    .. dropdown:: Previous releases

        .. dropdown:: 7.0.5 - October 3, 2024

            Concordium node version 7.0.5 contains support for `protocol version 7 <https://proposals.concordium.software/updates/P7.html>`_.
            The new consensus protocol will take effect on the mainnet on October 30, 2024.
            **Node runners should upgrade to version 7.0.5 before the protocol update to ensure that their nodes do not shut down.**

            Protocol version 7 introduces the following changes:

            - The cool-down behavior when the stake of a validator or delegator is reduced or removed is changed:

                - When stake is reduced, the reduction is immediately effective for future stake calculations, and the amount of the reduction is locked for a cool-down period.
                    (Previously, the reduction was only effective after the cool-down period.)

                - Validators and delegators can make further changes to their stake while they already have stake in cooldown.
                    This includes registering as a validator when the account was previously a delegator, or vice versa.
                    (Previously, the account had to wait for the cool-down period to end before making further changes.)

            - Shielded transfers are no longer supported in the protocol.
                It is still possible to unshield a previously shielded balance.

            - Smart contract execution costs are reduced.
                This reflects a more efficient implementation of the smart contract execution engine introduced in this release.

            - Smart contracts can now query the module reference and contract name of a smart contract instance.

            - The block hashing scheme is redefined to better support light clients.

            Additionaly, the node release includes a number of fixes and improvements:

            - Logging around protocol updates is improved.
            - Failed gRPC requests are now logged at ``DEBUG`` level.
            - Fixed a bug where ``GetBakersRewardPeriod`` returns incorrect data.
            - Fixed a bug where ``GetPoolInfo`` returns incorrect data.
            - Fixed a bug where a configure-validator transaction that is rejected for having a duplicate aggregation key reports the old key of the validator, rather than the new (duplicative) key.
            - Improved the behavior of the node in the event of an unrecoverable error in consensus.

        .. dropdown:: 6.3.2 - September 30, 2024

            Concordium node version 6.3.2 fixes a bug in the handling of smart contract names that could cause the node to crash.
            **This is a critical bug fix, and node runners should update as soon as possible.**

        .. dropdown:: 6.3.1 - June 24, 2024

            Concordium node version 6.3.1 fixes a bug where a node may fail to produce a timeout certificate due to incorrectly computing the total weight of finalizers that have signed timeout messages.

        .. dropdown:: 6.3.0 - February 27, 2024

            Version 6.3.0 contains the following fixes and improvements:

            - Fixed a bug where ``GetBlockPendingUpdates`` fails to report pending updates to the finalization committee parameters.
            - GRPC queries are now run in dedicated threads. This improves node resource management and increases responsiveness of the GRPC server in cases of high number of concurrent queries. To support this a new option ``--grpc2-max-threads`` (environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_MAX_THREADS``) has been added, which specifies the number of threads that the node should use for processing gRPC requests. If not set this defaults to the number of (logical) CPUs.
            - The option ``--grpc2-max-concurrent-streams`` now defaults to 200 from the previous unbounded value. This makes the node defaults safer.
            - Startup time of the node has improved on all supported distributions.

        .. dropdown:: 6.2.3 - November 28, 2023

            Version 6.2.3 removes the V1 gRPC API. This removes the configuration options ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_RPC_SERVER_PORT``, ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_RPC_SERVER_ADDRESS``, ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_RPC_SERVER_TOKEN``, ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_DISABLE_RPC_SERVER_NODE_ENDPOINTS`` and their command line equivalents. An additional health-check service was also added to the V2 GRPC API. This service conforms to the `standard GRPC health service API <https://github.com/grpc/grpc-proto/blob/master/grpc/health/v1/health.proto>`__.

            As part of the tokenomics changes the node has new configuration options that use the new terminology. The existing options using the legacy terminology are still supported, however they are hidden.

            A ``DryRun`` endpoint has also been that allows simulating the execution of transactions.

            The account map is now kept solely on disk in a separate LMDB database and it is no longer part of the internal block state database. This change results in significantly reduced resource usage for the node.

        .. dropdown:: 6.1.7 - October 23, 2023

            Concordium Node 6.1.7 contains bug fixes and improvements. **This is the last release of the node that has support for V1 gRPC API.**

            **Improvements**

                - Out-of-band catchup is now enabled by default on all platforms.

                - The node remembers peers across restarts. When starting up it will try to connect to stored peers in addition to any supplied bootstrap and given nodes. Use the new flag ``--clear-persisted-peers`` (environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_CLEAR_PERSISTED_PEERS``) to clear stored peers on startup.

                - If the node is `configured with TLS <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/blob/main/docs/grpc2.md#grpc-api-v2>`_, then `CONCORDIUM_NODE_COLLECTOR_GRPC_HOST` must be configured such that it uses the domain of the certificate, for example, ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_COLLECTOR_GRPC_HOST=https://example.concordium-node.io:20000``.

                - Exposed the health check service via grpc-web when grpc-web is enabled.

                - Banned peers are no longer reset on startup by default. The flag ``--no-clear-bans`` has been renamed  to ``--clear-bans``; when set it will clear the banned peers on startup.

                - Add debug-level logging when a round is advanced, either due to a quorum certificate or a timeout certificate.

                - Removed the concept of pending blocks.

                - ``GetPoolInfo`` now also returns the commission rates for the current reward period.

                - Added a number of endpoints to the GRPCV2 API, including:

                    - ``GetBakersRewardPeriod``: provided a block, then it returns information about bakers for the reward period of the block.

                    - ``GetBlockCertificates``: provided a block, then it returns quorum certificate, timeout certificate, and epoch finalization entry contained in the block (where present).

                    - ``GetBakerEarliestWinTime``: provided a baker ID, it returns the earliest time at which the node projects that the baker could be required to bake a block.

                    - ``GetFirstBlockEpoch``: returns the block hash of the first block in a given epoch.

                    - ``GetWinningBakersEpoch``: returns a list of the bakers that won rounds in a specified (finalized) epoch. This only supports consensus version 1.

            **Fixes**

                - An incorrect ``peer_bucket_size`` metric calculation exposed by the bootstrapper was fixed. What was counted was not the number of peers in the bucket, but rather, roughly, how many times peers that are in the bucket have reconnected.

                - Fixed a bug where the block state hash was not returned properly for the genesis block.

                - Fixed a bug where credential registration IDs for genesis accounts were not correctly recorded. As a result, the index of accounts by credential IDs was incorrect if the chain was started from genesis by node versions 5.1.3 up to and including 6.0. If a chain was started by an older node version and then the node was upgraded, the index is loaded correctly. This index is used when checking for duplicate credential registration IDs, and when looking up an account via a credential registration ID.

                - Fixed a bug in the ``InvokeInstance`` endpoint where the amount sent was used incorrectly. The consequence was that in some cases the calls would fail with an error indicating insufficient amount on the account where the amount was sufficient for the transaction.

                - Applied fix for processing of chain parameter updates when they occur at the same time retroactively to all protocol versions. This may break compatibility with any local/private chains on which the bug occurs.

                - Fixed a bug in how the last timeout certificate is recovered at start-up.

                - Fixed the behavior of the block last finalized pointer in the ``GetBlockInfo`` so that it consistently returns the last finalized block at the time the block was baked.

                - Added load shedding for gRPC v2. This helps protect the node in case of high number of concurrent requests since they are now dropped immediately as opposed to queued.

        .. dropdown:: 6.0.4 - September 11, 2023

            Concordium Node 6.0.4 contains support for `protocol version 6 <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals/blob/main/updates/P6.txt>`_ with Concordium BFT consensus which will be released September 25, 2023. **Node runners should upgrade to version 6.0.4. before the protocol update to ensure that their nodes do not shut down.**

            Also, gRPC v1 is NOT enabled in any of the node distributions. gRPC v2 should be used. As a consequence of this the configuration option ``no-rpc-server`` and environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_DISABLE_RPC_SERVER``, as well as default values of ``rpc-server-port`` (``CONCORDIUM_NODE_RPC_SERVER_PORT``) and ``rpc-server-addr`` (``CONCORDIUM_NODE_RPC_SERVER_ADDR``), have been removed. The V1 gRPC server is only started if both of these options are supplied.

            Additional features of this release include:

            - Fixed a network layer bug where initial messages after the handshake could be dropped in some circumstances.

            - Changes in Wasm validation and execution in P6 include:

                - Disallowed globals in initialization sections for V1 contracts in P6.

                - Added support for sign extension instructions in Wasm in P6.

                - Do not count custom sections towards module size when executing contracts.

                - Support new ``invoke`` operations for retrieving account keys and checking signatures.

            - Shut down consensus upon a protocol update updating from protocol version 6.

            - Fixed a bug that causes bakers in genesis to restake their earnings when they should not. This affects genesis data at protocol version P5; P1-P4 genesis data are not affected. This breaks compatibility with chains started with P5 genesis data, where some genesis bakers are not set to restake earnings. Other chains (including mainnet and testnet) are not affected.

            - Changed the ``GetConsensusStatus`` endpoint so that slot duration is only returned in protocol versions 0-5.

                - Endpoint is extended to return current timeout duration, current round, current epoch and trigger block time in protocol version 6.

            - Changed the ``GetBlockInfo`` endpoint:

                - Block slot is only returned in protocol versions 0-5.

                - In protocol version 6, the returned finalized block is the last finalized block until itself is finalized. Then it is itself.

                - Endpoint extended to return block round and epoch in protocol version 6.

            - Changed the `GetElectionInfo` endpoint so that election difficulty is only returned in protocol versions 0-5.

        .. dropdown:: 5.4.2 - June 14, 2023

            .. _542-mainnet:

            Concordium node version 5.4.2 contains the following features and bug fixes:

            - Enable CORS support in grpc-web. This only applies when grpc-web is enabled.

            - Fixed a security issue.

            - Support using block height as block identifiers in gRPC v2 API.

            - Extend gRPC v2 API call ``GetBlockInfo`` with the protocol version of the block.

            - Do not keep a historical list of peers when running as a normal node.

            - Fixed a bug that caused an extra byte to be added when running ``getModuleSource`` in the V1 GRPC API.

        .. dropdown:: 5.3.2 - April 27, 2023

            .. _532-mainnet:

            - Extended the Prometheus exporter with the following metrics: grpc_request_duration_seconds, grpc_in_flight_requests, consensus_baking_committee, consensus_finalization_committee, consensus_baking_lottery_power, consensus_baked_blocks_total, consensus_finalized_baked_blocks_total, network_soft_banned_peers_total, consensus_non_finalized_transactions and consensus_unsupported_pending_protocol_version. See `docs/prometheus-exporter.md <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/blob/main/docs/prometheus-exporter.md>`_ for more details.

            - Also, in the changelog for the node grpc_request_duration_seconds has been renamed to grpc_request_response_time_seconds to match the what is in the code.

            - Added the following new options:

                - The ``--grpc2-health-min-peers`` (environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_HEALTH_MIN_PEERS``) triggers the grpc V2 health endpoint to check minimum number of peers.

                - ``--grpc2-invoke-max-energy`` (environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_INVOKE_MAX_ENERGY``) allows the node runner to control the maximum amount of energy allowed by an InvokeInstance (and the V1 GRPC InvokeContract) call. The behavior of the endpoint is slightly changed as well. The energy is no longer required in the request, and the effective energy used by the call will be min(request.energy, grpc-invoke-max-energy). This differs from the previous behavior where a request would fail if the request either omitted the energy, or supplied an excessive value.

            - Improved the node health check, so that if the node is configured with baker credentials, then it is required to be in the baking committee for it to be considered healthy.

            - Fixed a bug that could cause the node to hang indefinitely during the out-of-band-catchup when the node is a finalizer.

            - Fixed an additional bug in the ``GetAccountInfo`` endpoint in GRPCv2 where the incoming_amounts field of encrypted amounts was not always set correctly.

            - The node collector is migrated to a separate package and now uses the V2 GRPC API. If you already have a node installed, you must update the configuration. For more information, see the Run a node topic that is specific to your node platform: :ref:`Linux<run-a-node>`, :ref:`Ubuntu<run-node-ubuntu>`, :ref:`Windows<run-node-windows>`, or :ref:`macOS<run-node-macos>`.

        .. dropdown:: 5.2.4 - March 16, 2023

            - The Prometheus metrics exporter has been improved and systematized, making this API stable from this release onwards to monitor your node metrics. The metrics are now `documented <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/blob/main/docs/prometheus-exporter.md>`_ and the node's Prometheus metrics API stability will adhere to SEMVER guidelines.

            - Fixed an issue where the node configuration file (``main.config.json``) was sometimes corrupted.

            - Added an option to disable only the node specific grpc V1 endpoints that can be used to control the node. All the endpoints that are consensus related are kept allowing the node to be used as a gateway to the chain. The mentioned endpoints can be disabled by setting ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_DISABLE_RPC_SERVER_NODE_ENDPOINTS`` or using the flag ``--no-rpc-server-node-endpoints``.

            - Fixed a bug in ``GetAccountInfo`` endpoint in GRPCv2 where ``incoming_amounts`` field of encrypted amounts was not set correctly.

        .. dropdown:: 5.1.3 - January 19, 2023

            Concordium node version 5.1.3 introduces the following new features and improvements:

            - Improvements were made to allow greater concurrency with transaction processing.

            - Blocks are relayed earlier. This decreases the time it takes for the network to become aware of a block.

            - Removed the configuration option ``no_rebroadcast_consensus_validation``. This option (which was used for testing only and was disabled by default) made the node rebroadcast blocks before doing any validation.

            - Changes were made to avoid deadlocks during node shutdown in specific scenarios.

            - The node will now shut down to start if an error occurs in a required service (e.g., grpc server). In particular, the node will shut down if a required service could not be started.

            - Added timeout to downloading out of band catchup files when block indices and catch-up chunk files are specified by an URL. The timeout is controlled by the option ``--download-blocks-timeout`` (environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_DOWNLOAD_BLOCKS_TIMEOUT``) and defaults to 5 minutes. Timeout is now five minutes per chunk instead of waiting indefinitely.

            - Removed the ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_PROMETHEUS_SERVER`` environment variable. The prometheus server is now started if ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_PROMETHEUS_LISTEN_PORT`` is set.

        .. dropdown:: 5.0.7 for macOS - January 4, 2023

            Fix a bug in the macOS node that caused an issue with NRG calculation. Concordium recommends that macOS node runners update their nodes to 5.0.7.

        .. dropdown:: 5.0.6 - November 29, 2022

            Concordium Node 5.0.6 contains support for `protocol version 5 <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals/blob/main/updates/P5.txt>`_ which will be released on Mainnet on December 13, 2022. This adds the following features:

            - Support for smart contract upgradability
            - Query the current exchange rates, account balances, and contract balances from a smart contract.
            - Relax restrictions on smart contracts, including:
                - Parameter size limit: 1kiB -> 65535B
                - Return value size limit: 16kiB -> no limit (apart from energy)
                - Number of logs per invocation: 64 -> no limit (apart from energy)
            - A new representation of accounts that is better optimised for common operations.
            - Revised the hashing scheme for transaction outcomes in protocol version 5. In particular, the exact reject reasons are no longer part of the computed hash. Furthermore, the transaction outcomes are being stored in a merkle tree for P5, resulting in faster speed for some queries.

            Additionally, the node update fixes an issue where the catch-up downloader would fail at a protocol update.

        .. dropdown:: 4.5.0 - October 25, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.5.0 contains the :ref:`updated gRPC API <grpc2-documentation>` which is easier to use than the previous version. It also contains bug fixes and performance and robustness improvements.

            - Node gRPC API v2 is released and enabled in all distributions.
            - The node is now able to recover after crashes which leave only treestate or only blockstate usable.
            - Fix a memory leak that could occur in certain usage scenarios involving smart contracts.

        .. dropdown:: 4.4.4 - October 5, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.4.4 contains performance improvements and bug fixes.

            - Smart contract state is no longer cached on startup and is not cached after finalization. This reduces the node's memory use and startup time.

            - Smart contract modules are no longer retained in memory. Module artifacts are loaded as needed during contract execution. Metadata is cached for a limited number of smart contract modules. By default, the cache will retain metadata for at most 1000 smart contract modules, and this is configurable via the ``--modules-cache-size`` command line argument or by using the ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_MODULES_CACHE_SIZE`` environment variable.

            - Speed up and reduce memory overhead during protocol updates. Overhead in memory use during protocol updates should now be less than 20%, and time to process a protocol update should be around 1/3 of the previous release.

            - The node now validates blocks more eagerly and does not relay blocks it cannot fit into the tree, i.e., pending blocks.

            - The ``--download-blocks-from`` option now takes the URL to the catchup ``_index file_``, permitting to only download and import catchup files containing blocks not already present in the database.

            - Partial node database recovery. The node is now able to recover from the most common causes of its database corruption.

            - Fix typo in environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_PROMETHEUS_LISTEN_ADDRESSS`` (remove trailing `S`).

            - Fix a bug in Ctrl-C signal handling where a node would fail to stop if interrupted early on in the startup if out-of-band catchup was enabled.

        .. dropdown:: 4.3.1 - September 5, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.3.1 introduces a number of performance improvements. The effects of these are that the node on mainnet at the current load will use around 1/4 the memory of the `4.2.3` node. Startup can be up to 50% faster, although exact improvements will be platform dependent.

            - Account records are no longer constantly retained in memory. Instead, a limited number are retained in a cache. The number of cached accounts defaults to 10000 and can be configured by the ``--accounts-cache-size`` command line argument or the ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_ACCOUNTS_CACHE_SIZE`` environment variable.
            - Reduce startup time and memory use further by reducing the amount of block data retained in memory. In particular finalized blocks are no longer stored in memory.
            - Optimize node data structures related to accounts. This reduces node memory use and improves performance.
            - The gRPC API now reports correctly when the sender of a transaction did not have enough funds to cover the transaction costs.
            - Remove obsolete and unused option ``--max-expiry-duration``.
            - Remove transaction logging functionality from the node. It is replaced by an external `transaction logger <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-transaction-logger>`_ service. As a consequence the ``transaction-outcome-logging`` family of command line options are removed from the node.

        .. dropdown:: 4.2.3 for Docker - August 4, 2022

            Some improvements have been made to the Docker node version. The new Docker images (one for Mainnet and one for Testnet) are designed for use with docker-compose or a similar driver. The node also requires a database which must be stored on the host system so that it persists when the Docker container is stopped.

            It is not mandatory but **strongly recommended** for Linux node runners to migrate to the new Docker distribution. The old Docker images will be deprecated and future node versions from 4.3 and upwards will only be provided in the new distribution.

        .. dropdown:: 4.2.3 - August 2, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.2.3 fixes a critical security vulnerability present in all previous 4.* node versions. All node runners **must** upgrade as soon as possible.

            The security advisory detailing the issue and the patch will be released on August 15th.

        .. dropdown:: 4.2.1 - July 4, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.2.1 is a maintenance release, bringing performance improvements and bugfixes. The highlights are:

            - A significant decrease in node startup time. The exact improvements are platform dependent, but startup should be at least 6 times faster on mainnet.
            - A significant decrease in node memory use. On mainnet, a 4.2.1 node should use less than 50% of memory compared to 4.1.1.
            - Reduced CPU use of passive nodes in Windows, Mac, and Linux distributions.

        .. dropdown:: 4.1.1 - June 15, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.1.1 (Sirius) introduces new functionality to support delegation to baker pools or passive delegation, and a new version Smart Contracts.

            Note that when the protocol update happens on June 23, 2022 that the cool-down period for reducing baker stake or stopping baking increases from one week to three weeks. If you reduce your stake or stop baking BEFORE the protocol update takes effect, the cool-down remains one week.

            V1 smart contracts include the following key features:
            - Unlimited contract state size
            - Synchronous contract calls
            - Fallback entrypoints
            - An increased smart contract module size limit of 512kB
            - A number of cryptographic primitives

            Other improvements in this version include:
            - The SendTransaction function exposed via the gRPC interface now provides the caller with detailed error messages.
            - Support for wire-protocol version 0 is dropped, meaning that the node cannot connect to peers that do not support wire-protocol version 1, which is supported since version 1.1.0.
            - The macOS installer has been improved so it no longer overwrites the service files when reinstalling.
            - When using the Mac installer users now can leave one (but not both) of the net configurations empty when they don't want to configure a node for it. On the initial installation, leaving a net configuration empty means that the start/stop app shortcuts and the application support folder for that net won't be installed.
            - Consensus queries have been made more robust by validating input more extensively. This affects all queries whose input was a block or transaction hash. These queries now return an InvalidArgument error.
            - The maximum number of retries for Node Collector has been removed so it will keep querying indefinitely.
            - Nodes can now be stopped during out of band catchup by using the signals ``SIGINT`` and ``SIGTERM``.
            - The ``GetAccountInfo`` endpoint supports querying the account via the account index.
            - Baker pools and stake delegation are implemented for the P4 protocol version.
            - The new gRPC endpoint ``GetBakerList`` retrieves a JSON list of the baker IDs of the bakers registered in a known block. It returns null for an unknown block.
            - The new gRPC endpoint ``GetPoolStatus`` retrieves a status record for a baker pool, or for the set of passive delegators.
            - The bakerStakeThreshold level-2 keys are renamed to poolParameters keys; two additional access structures are defined: cooldownParameters and timeParameters.
            - Smart contract modules are cached on startup from the existing state to improve smart contract execution.

            .. Note::

                Prior to Sirius, the nodes enforced that a transaction could not be deployed until 2 hours before its expiry date. With Sirius, node validation of transactions has been improved and the 2 hour window has been removed.

        .. dropdown:: 3.0.2 - April 21, 2022

            Fixed a security vulnerability in the network layer that could be used to crash the node, causing a denial of service.

        .. dropdown:: 3.0.1 - January 7, 2022

            Fixed a starvation bug in some cases of parallel node queries.

        .. dropdown:: 3.0.0 - December 17, 2021

            - Introduced support for account aliases via protocol P3. Accounts can be queried in ``GetAccountInfo``, ``GetAccountNonFinalizedTransactions``, ``GetNextAccountNonce`` by any alias.
            - ``GetAccountInfo`` object now has an additional field ``accountAddress`` that contains the canonical address of the account.
            - Fixed a bug due to incorrect use of LMDB database environments, where a node would crash if queried at specific times.
            - Faster state queries by avoiding locking the block state file when reading.
            - Fixed a bug caused by shutting down RPC before the node, which caused the node to crash when attempting a graceful shutdown while processing RPC requests.
            - The node now drops all connections on an unrecognized protocol update and refuses to accept new transactions.

        .. dropdown:: 1.1.3 - October 6, 2021

            The Concordium node release v1.1.3 implements a protocol update to add memo functionality for simple, shielded and scheduled transfers.
            This means that node runners **must upgrade** their nodes before the new protocol takes effect on testnet on October 13 at 12:00 CEST, 2021. Old nodes will stop processing new blocks at that point. See `protocol updates <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals>`_ for more details.

            - Added memo functionality for transactions to Protocol
            - Windows support for running a node
            - Mac support for running a node
            - Mac ARM M1 support for running a node
            - Various bug fixes

        .. dropdown:: 1.0.0 - June 9, 2021

            We are proud to announce that version 1 of the Concordium blockchain infrastructure, the “Alpha Centauri” release, is available for download.

            Our Mainnet release has the following main features:

            **Proof of Stake**

            The Concordium Blockchain uses a proof of stake mechanism to ensure resource-efficient operation of the network.

            **Two Layer Consensus Protocol**

            -  Nakamoto-Style Consensus
                Bakers participate in a form of lottery to win the right to append blocks to the chain.

            -  Finality Layer
                Concordium finality layer dynamically ‘checkpoints’ the blockchain using Byzantine agreement to identify and mark common blocks in the chains of honest users as final.

            **Built in IDLayer**

            Account creation is based on a validated identity, but at the same time it provides transactional privacy for users with a mechanism that allows accountability to local regulatory authorities.

            Transactional privacy is further enhanced by support for shielded transfers.

            **Smart Contracts**

            Concordium blockchain has native support for smart contracts on-chain with our core on-chain language WebAssembly (Wasm), a portable well-defined assembly-like language.

            Rust is the first off-chain high level smart contract language.

            **Tokenomics and On-chain Incentivization**

            The Concordium blockchain comprises a set of transactions and economic roles that interact within the economy. An economic role, such as a baker or account holder, is represented by an account on the Concordium platform.

            The flow of CCD between accounts via transactions creates an economy that is designed to incentivize participation in the network and counter dishonest behaviour. It is the objective of the Concordium Foundation to guide the creation of a sustainable economy that rewards participants for their efforts in developing the network.

            **Concordium Node**

            The Concordium node software is available for Linux and available in two different packages:

            -  A distribution package, which provides wrappers for setting up the node in a Docker image.

            -  A Debian package built for Ubuntu 20.04. This package allows for greater customization of the node set up.

            **Mobile Wallet**

            The Mobile Wallet is available for iOS and Android with support for:

            -  identity issuance and management.
            -  account creation and management.
            -  simple and shielded transactions.
            -  platform security protection
            -  export and import to other mobile wallets.
            -  access to the blockchain through a “wallet proxy” operated by Concordium with no need to run a node.

            **Desktop Wallet**

            The Desktop Wallet is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux with support for:

            -  identity issuance and management.
            -  account creation and management.
            -  protection by Ledger Nano S device.
            -  multi signature account set up and management.
            -  multiple transaction types:
            -  Simple
            -  Scheduled
            -  Shielded
            -  Multi-signature
            -  filtering and printing historic transactions
            -  baker management
            -  access to blockchain via a service node, which is usually owned by the user of the Desktop Wallet.

            **Source Code**

            The source code for the Concordium Blockchain is free open source software. You can access our repositories on the `Concordium GitHub organization page <https://github.com/Concordium>`_.

Testnet
-------

    August 18, 2025

    Concordium node version 9.0.7 contains support for `protocol version 9 <https://proposals.concordium.software/updates/P9.html>`_.
    The new consensus protocol will take effect on the testnet on August 27, 2025.
    **Node runners should upgrade to version 9.0.7 before the protocol update to ensure that their nodes do not shut down.**
    Validators that do not upgrade before the protocol update may be suspended.

    Protocol version 9 introduces Protocol-Level Tokens (PLTs), which enable chain-native support for tokens other than CCD, without reliance on smart contracts.
    Protocol version 9 supports the following PLT functionality:

        - creating new PLTs (through the CreatePLT chain update);

        - transferring PLTs between accounts;

        - minting and burning PLTs (limited to the nominated token governance account);

        - managing permissions for which accounts can send and receive each PLT through an allow- or deny-list (limited to the governance account); and

        - globally pausing or unpausing balance changing operations for a PLT (limited to the governance account).

    The node API is updated to support PLTs as follows:

        - ``GetAccountInfo`` reports information about PLTs associated with the account, including any balance.

        - ``GetTokenList`` reports a list of the registered PLTs on the chain.

        - ``GetTokenInfo`` gets the global state information for a particular PLT.

    Note: **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is no longer supported;** the minimum supported version for this release is 22.04 LTS.

    .. dropdown:: Previous releases

        .. dropdown:: 8.0.3 - February 18, 2025

            Concordium node version 8.0.3 contains support for `protocol version 8 <https://proposals.concordium.software/updates/P8.html>`_.
            The new consensus protocol will take effect on the testnet on February 24, 2025.
            **Node runners should upgrade to version 8.0.3 before the protocol update to ensure that their nodes do not shut down.**
            Validators in particular are encouraged to update their nodes, as the new protocol introduces suspension of inactive validators, meaning that failing to update may result in your validator being suspended.

            Protocol version 8 introduces the following changes:

                - Validators are automatically suspended if they do not produce blocks for a certain number of rounds.

                - The configure-validator transaction can suspend or resume a validator, including adding a validator in a suspended state.

                - Suspended validators are paused from participating in the consensus algorithm.

            Additionally, the node release includes a number of fixes and improvements:

                - Add suspension info to `BakerPoolStatus` / `CurrentPaydayBakerPoolStatus` query results.

                - Add `GetConsensusDetailedStatus` gRPC endpoint for getting detailed information on the status of the consensus, at consensus version 1.

                - Update Rust version to 1.82.

                - Update GHC version to 9.6.6 (LTS-22.39).

                - Add `GetScheduledReleaseAccounts` endpoint for querying the list of accounts that have scheduled releases.

                - Add `GetCooldownAccounts`, `GetPreCooldownAccounts` and `GetPrePreCooldownAccounts` endpoints for querying the lists of accounts that have pending cooldowns in protocol version 7 onwards.

                - gRPC endpoints `DryRun`, `GetBlockItemStatus` and `GetBlockTransactionEvents` now report the parameter used to initialize a smart contract instance as part of a `ContractInitializedEvent`.

                - Fix a bug where, after a protocol update in consensus version 1 (P6 onwards), a node may miscalculate the absolute height of blocks when it is restarted.

                - Fix a bug where `GetBlockInfo` reports the parent block of a genesis block to be the last finalized block of the previous genesis index, instead of the terminal block.

        .. dropdown:: 7.0.5 - September 30, 2024

            Concordium node version 7.0.5 fixes a bug in the handling of smart contract names that could cause the node to crash.
            **This is a critical bug fix, and node runners should update as soon as possible.**

        .. dropdown:: 7.0.4 - September 23, 2024

            Concordium node version 7.0.4 contains support for `protocol version 7 <https://proposals.concordium.software/updates/P7.html>`_.
            The new consensus protocol will take effect on the testnet on September 30, 2024.
            **Node runners should upgrade to version 7.0.4 before the protocol update to ensure that their nodes do not shut down.**

            Protocol version 7 introduces the following changes:

            - The cool-down behavior when the stake of a validator or delegator is reduced or removed is changed:

                - When stake is reduced, the reduction is immediately effective for future stake calculations, and the amount of the reduction is locked for a cool-down period.
                  (Previously, the reduction was only effective after the cool-down period.)

                - Validators and delegators can make further changes to their stake while they already have stake in cooldown.
                  This includes registering as a validator when the account was previously a delegator, or vice versa.
                  (Previously, the account had to wait for the cool-down period to end before making further changes.)

            - Shielded transfers are no longer supported in the protocol.
              It is still possible to unshield a previously shielded balance.

            - Smart contract execution costs are reduced.
              This reflects a more efficient implementation of the smart contract execution engine introduced in this release.

            - Smart contracts can now query the module reference and contract name of a smart contract instance.

            - The block hashing scheme is redefined to better support light clients.

            Additionaly, the node release includes a number of fixes and improvements:

            - Logging around protocol updates is improved.
            - Failed gRPC requests are now logged at ``DEBUG`` level.
            - Fixed a bug where ``GetBakersRewardPeriod`` returns incorrect data.
            - Fixed a bug where ``GetPoolInfo`` returns incorrect data.
            - Fixed a bug where a configure-validator transaction that is rejected for having a duplicate aggregation key reports the old key of the validator, rather than the new (duplicative) key.
            - Improved the behavior of the node in the event of an unrecoverable error in consensus.

        .. dropdown:: 6.3.1 - June 20, 2024

            Concordium node version 6.3.1 fixes a bug where a node may fail to produce a timeout certificate due to incorrectly computing the total weight of finalizers that have signed timeout messages.


        .. dropdown:: 6.3.0 - February 20, 2024

            Version 6.3.0 contains the following fixes and improvements:

            - Fixed a bug where ``GetBlockPendingUpdates`` fails to report pending updates to the finalization committee parameters.
            - GRPC queries are now run in dedicated threads. This improves node resource management and increases responsiveness of the GRPC server in cases of high number of concurrent queries. To support this a new option ``--grpc2-max-threads`` (environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_MAX_THREADS``) has been added, which specifies the number of threads that the node should use for processing gRPC requests. If not set this defaults to the number of (logical) CPUs.
            - The option ``--grpc2-max-concurrent-streams`` now defaults to 200 from the previous unbounded value. This makes the node defaults safer.
            - Startup time of the node has improved on all supported distributions.

        .. dropdown:: 6.2.3 - November 28, 2023

                Version 6.2.3 removes the V1 gRPC API. This removes the configuration options ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_RPC_SERVER_PORT``, ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_RPC_SERVER_ADDRESS``, ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_RPC_SERVER_TOKEN``, ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_DISABLE_RPC_SERVER_NODE_ENDPOINTS`` and their command line equivalents. An additional health-check service was also added to the V2 GRPC API. This service conforms to the `standard GRPC health service API <https://github.com/grpc/grpc-proto/blob/master/grpc/health/v1/health.proto>`__.

                As part of the tokenomics changes the node has new configuration options that use the new terminology. The existing options using the legacy terminology are still supported, however they are hidden.

                A ``DryRun`` endpoint has also been that allows simulating the execution of transactions.

                The account map is now kept solely on disk in a separate LMDB database and it is no longer part of the internal block state database. This change results in significantly reduced resource usage for the node.

        .. dropdown:: 6.1.7 - October 16, 2023

            Version 6.1.7 adds load shedding for gRPC v2. This helps with protecting the node in case of high number of concurrent requests since they are now dropped immediately as opposed to queued.

        .. dropdown:: 6.1.6 - October 10, 2023

            Concordium Node 6.1.6 contains bug fixes and improvements. **This is the last release of the node that has support for V1 gRPC API.**

            **Improvements**

                - Out-of-band catchup is now enabled by default on all platforms.

                - The node remembers peers across restarts. When starting up it will try to connect to stored peers in addition to any supplied bootstrap and given nodes. Use the new flag ``--clear-persisted-peers`` (environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_CLEAR_PERSISTED_PEERS``) to clear stored peers on startup.

                - If the node is `configured with TLS <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/blob/main/docs/grpc2.md#grpc-api-v2>`_, then `CONCORDIUM_NODE_COLLECTOR_GRPC_HOST` must be configured such that it uses the domain of the certificate, for example, ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_COLLECTOR_GRPC_HOST=https://example.concordium-node.io:20000``.

                - Exposed the health check service via grpc-web when grpc-web is enabled.

                - Banned peers are no longer reset on startup by default. The flag ``--no-clear-bans`` has been renamed  to ``--clear-bans``; when set it will clear the banned peers on startup.

                - Add debug-level logging when a round is advanced, either due to a quorum certificate or a timeout certificate.

                - Removed the concept of pending blocks.

                - ``GetPoolInfo`` now also returns the commission rates for the current reward period.

                - Added a number of endpoints to the GRPCV2 API, including:

                    - ``GetBakersRewardPeriod``: provided a block, then it returns information about bakers for the reward period of the block.

                    - ``GetBlockCertificates``: provided a block, then it returns quorum certificate, timeout certificate, and epoch finalization entry contained in the block (where present).

                    - ``GetBakerEarliestWinTime``: provided a baker ID, it returns the earliest time at which the node projects that the baker could be required to bake a block.

                    - ``GetFirstBlockEpoch``: returns the block hash of the first block in a given epoch.

                    - ``GetWinningBakersEpoch``: returns a list of the bakers that won rounds in a specified (finalized) epoch. This only supports consensus version 1.

            **Fixes**

                - An incorrect ``peer_bucket_size`` metric calculation exposed by the bootstrapper was fixed. What was counted was not the number of peers in the bucket, but rather, roughly, how many times peers that are in the bucket have reconnected.

                - Fixed a bug where the block state hash was not returned properly for the genesis block.

                - Fixed a bug where credential registration IDs for genesis accounts were not correctly recorded. As a result, the index of accounts by credential IDs was incorrect if the chain was started from genesis by node versions 5.1.3 up to and including 6.0. If a chain was started by an older node version and then the node was upgraded, the index is loaded correctly. This index is used when checking for duplicate credential registration IDs, and when looking up an account via a credential registration ID.

                - Fixed a bug in the ``InvokeInstance`` endpoint where the amount sent was used incorrectly. The consequence was that in some cases the calls would fail with an error indicating insufficient amount on the account where the amount was sufficient for the transaction.

                - Applied fix for processing of chain parameter updates when they occur at the same time retroactively to all protocol versions. This may break compatibility with any local/private chains on which the bug occurs.

                - Fixed a bug in how the last timeout certificate is recovered at start-up.

                - Fixed the behavior of the block last finalized pointer in the ``GetBlockInfo`` so that it consistently returns the last finalized block at the time the block was baked.

        .. dropdown:: 6.0.4 - August 9, 2023

            Concordium Node 6.0.4 contains support for `protocol version 6 <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals/blob/main/updates/P6.txt>`_ with Concordium BFT consensus which will be released August 21, 2023. **Node runners should upgrade to version 6.0.4. before the protocol update to ensure that their nodes do not shut down.**

            Also, gRPC v1 is NOT enabled in any of the node distributions. gRPC v2 should be used. As a consequence of this the configuration option ``no-rpc-server`` and environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_DISABLE_RPC_SERVER``, as well as default values of ``rpc-server-port`` (``CONCORDIUM_NODE_RPC_SERVER_PORT``) and ``rpc-server-addr`` (``CONCORDIUM_NODE_RPC_SERVER_ADDR``), have been removed. The V1 gRPC server is only started if both of these options are supplied.

            Additional features of this release include:

            - Fixed a network layer bug where initial messages after the handshake could be dropped in some circumstances.

            - Changes in Wasm validation and execution in P6 include:

                - Disallowed globals in initialization sections for V1 contracts in P6.

                - Added support for sign extension instructions in Wasm in P6.

                - Do not count custom sections towards module size when executing contracts.

                - Support new ``invoke`` operations for retrieving account keys and checking signatures.

            - Shut down consensus upon a protocol update updating from protocol version 6.

            - Fixed a bug that causes bakers in genesis to restake their earnings when they should not. This affects genesis data at protocol version P5; P1-P4 genesis data are not affected. This breaks compatibility with chains started with P5 genesis data, where some genesis bakers are not set to restake earnings. Other chains (including mainnet and testnet) are not affected.

            - Changed the ``GetConsensusStatus`` endpoint so that slot duration is only returned in protocol versions 0-5.

                - Endpoint is extended to return current timeout duration, current round, current epoch and trigger block time in protocol version 6.

            - Changed the ``GetBlockInfo`` endpoint:

                - Block slot is only returned in protocol versions 0-5.

                - In protocol version 6, the returned finalized block is the last finalized block until itself is finalized. Then it is itself.

                - Endpoint extended to return block round and epoch in protocol version 6.

            - Changed the ElectionInfo endpoint so that Election difficulty is only returned in protocol versions 0-5.

        .. dropdown:: 5.4.2 - June 7, 2023

            Concordium node version 5.4.2 fixes a bug that caused an extra byte to be added when running ``getModuleSource`` in the V1 GRPC API.

        .. dropdown:: 5.4.1 - June 1, 2023

            Concordium node version 5.4.1 contains the following features and bug fixes:

            - Enable CORS support in grpc-web. This only applies when grpc-web is enabled.

            - Fixed a security issue.

            - Support using block height as block identifiers in gRPC v2 API.

            - Extend gRPC v2 API call ``GetBlockInfo`` with the protocol version of the block.

            - Do not keep a historical list of peers when running as a normal node.

        .. dropdown:: 5.3.2 - April 20, 2023

            - Extended the Prometheus exporter with the following metrics: grpc_request_duration_seconds, grpc_in_flight_requests, consensus_baking_committee, consensus_finalization_committee, consensus_baking_lottery_power, consensus_baked_blocks_total, consensus_finalized_baked_blocks_total, network_soft_banned_peers_total, consensus_non_finalized_transactions and consensus_unsupported_pending_protocol_version. See `docs/prometheus-exporter.md <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/blob/main/docs/prometheus-exporter.md>`_ for more details.

            - Also, in the changelog for the node grpc_request_duration_seconds has been renamed to grpc_request_response_time_seconds to match the what is in the code.

            - Added the following new options:

            - The ``--grpc2-health-min-peers`` (environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_HEALTH_MIN_PEERS``) triggers the grpc V2 health endpoint to check minimum number of peers.

            - ``--grpc2-invoke-max-energy`` (environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_GRPC2_INVOKE_MAX_ENERGY``) allows the node runner to control the maximum amount of energy allowed by an InvokeInstance (and the V1 GRPC InvokeContract) call. The behavior of the endpoint is slightly changed as well. The energy is no longer required in the request, and the effective energy used by the call will be min(request.energy, grpc-invoke-max-energy). This differs from the previous behavior where a request would fail if the request either omitted the energy, or supplied an excessive value.

            - Improved the node health check, so that if the node is configured with baker credentials, then it is required to be in the baking committee for it to be considered healthy.

            - Fixed a bug that could cause the node to hang indefinitely during the out-of-band-catchup when the node is a finalizer.

            - Fixed an additional bug in the ``GetAccountInfo`` endpoint in GRPCv2 where the incoming_amounts field of encrypted amounts was not always set correctly.

            - The node collector is migrated to a separate package and now uses the V2 GRPC API. If you already have a node installed, you must update the configuration. For more information, see the Run a node topic that is specific to your node platform: :ref:`Linux<run-a-node>`, :ref:`Ubuntu<run-node-ubuntu>`, :ref:`Windows<run-node-windows>`, or :ref:`macOS<run-node-macos>`.

        .. dropdown:: 5.2.4 - March 09, 2023

            - The Prometheus metrics exporter has been improved and systematized, making this API stable from this release onwards to monitor your node metrics. The metrics are now `documented <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/blob/main/docs/prometheus-exporter.md>`_ and the node's Prometheus metrics API stability will adhere to SEMVER guidelines.

            - Fixed an issue where the node configuration file (``main.config.json``) was sometimes corrupted.

            - Added an option to disable only the node specific grpc V1 endpoints that can be used to control the node. All the endpoints that are consensus related are kept allowing the node to be used as a gateway to the chain. The mentioned endpoints can be disabled by setting ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_DISABLE_RPC_SERVER_NODE_ENDPOINTS`` or using the flag ``--no-rpc-server-node-endpoints``.

            - Fixed a bug in ``GetAccountInfo`` endpoint in GRPCv2 where ``incoming_amounts`` field of encrypted amounts was not set correctly.

        .. dropdown:: 5.1.3 - January 12, 2023

            Concordium node version 5.1.3 introduces the following new features and improvements:

            - Improvements were made to allow greater concurrency with transaction processing.

            - Blocks are relayed earlier. This decreases the time it takes for the network to become aware of a block.

            - Removed the configuration option ``no_rebroadcast_consensus_validation``. This option (which was used for testing only and was disabled by default) made the node rebroadcast blocks before doing any validation.

            - Changes were made to avoid deadlocks during node shutdown in specific scenarios.

            - The node will now shut down to start if an error occurs in a required service (e.g., grpc server). In particular, the node will shut down if a required service could not be started.

            - Added timeout to downloading out of band catchup files when block indices and catch-up chunk files are specified by an URL. The timeout is controlled by the option ``--download-blocks-timeout`` (environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_DOWNLOAD_BLOCKS_TIMEOUT``) and defaults to 5 minutes. Timeout is now five minutes per chunk instead of waiting indefinitely.

            - Removed the ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_PROMETHEUS_SERVER`` environment variable. The prometheus server is now started if ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_PROMETHEUS_LISTEN_PORT`` is set.

        .. dropdown:: 5.0.7 for macOS - January 4, 2023

            Fixed a bug in the macOS node that caused an issue with NRG calculation. Concordium recommends that macOS node runners update their nodes to 5.0.7.

        .. dropdown:: 5.0.6 - November 15, 2022

            Concordium Node 5.0.6 contains support for `protocol version 5 <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals/blob/main/updates/P5.txt>`_ which will be released November 22, 2022. This adds the following features:

            - Support for smart contract upgradability
            - Query the current exchange rates, account balances, and contract balances from a smart contract.
            - Relax restrictions on smart contracts, including:
                - Parameter size limit: 1kiB -> 65535B
                - Return value size limit: 16kiB -> no limit (apart from energy)
                - Number of logs per invocation: 64 -> no limit (apart from energy)
            - A new representation of accounts that is better optimised for common operations.
            - Revised the hashing scheme for transaction outcomes in protocol version 5. In particular, the exact reject reasons are no longer part of the computed hash. Furthermore, the transaction outcomes are being stored in a merkle tree for P5, resulting in faster speed for some queries.

            Additionally, the node update fixes an issue where the catch-up downloader would fail at a protocol update.

        .. dropdown:: 4.5.0 - October 18, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.5.0 contains the :ref:`updated gRPC API <grpc2-documentation>` which is easier to use than the previous version. It also contains bug fixes and performance and robustness improvements.

            - Node gRPC API v2 is released and enabled in all distributions.
            - The node is now able to recover after crashes which leave only treestate or only blockstate usable.
            - Fix a memory leak that could occur in certain usage scenarios involving smart contracts.

        .. dropdown:: 4.4.4 - September 29, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.4.4 contains performance improvements and bug fixes.

            - Smart contract state is no longer cached on startup and is not cached after finalization. This reduces the node's memory use and startup time.

            - Smart contract modules are no longer retained in memory. Module artifacts are loaded as needed during contract execution. Metadata is cached for a limited number of smart contract modules. By default, the cache will retain metadata for at most 1000 smart contract modules, and this is configurable via the ``--modules-cache-size`` command line argument or by using the ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_MODULES_CACHE_SIZE`` environment variable.

            - Speed up and reduce memory overhead during protocol updates. Overhead in memory use during protocol updates should now be less than 20%, and time to process a protocol update should be around 1/3 of the previous release.

            - The node now validates blocks more eagerly and does not relay blocks it cannot fit into the tree, i.e., pending blocks.

            - The ``--download-blocks-from`` option now takes the URL to the catchup ``_index file_``, permitting to only download and import catchup files containing blocks not already present in the database.

            - Partial node database recovery. The node is now able to recover from the most common causes of its database corruption.

            - Fix typo in environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_PROMETHEUS_LISTEN_ADDRESSS`` (remove trailing `S`).

            - Fix a bug in Ctrl-C signal handling where a node would fail to stop if interrupted early on in the startup if out-of-band catchup was enabled.

        .. dropdown:: 4.3.1 - August 29, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.3.1 introduces a number of performance improvements. The effects of these are that the node on mainnet at the current load will use around 1/4 the memory of the `4.2.3` node. Startup can be up to 50% faster, although exact improvements will be platform dependent.

            - Account records are no longer constantly retained in memory. Instead, a limited number are retained in a cache. The number of cached accounts defaults to 10000 and can be configured by the ``--accounts-cache-size`` command line argument or the ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_ACCOUNTS_CACHE_SIZE`` environment variable.
            - Reduce startup time and memory use further by reducing the amount of block data retained in memory. In particular finalized blocks are no longer stored in memory.
            - Optimize node data structures related to accounts. This reduces node memory use and improves performance.
            - The gRPC API now reports correctly when the sender of a transaction did not have enough funds to cover the transaction costs.
            - Remove obsolete and unused option ``--max-expiry-duration``.
            - Remove transaction logging functionality from the node. It is replaced by an external `transaction logger <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-transaction-logger>`_ service. As a consequence the ``transaction-outcome-logging`` family of command line options are removed from the node.

        .. dropdown:: 4.2.3 for Docker - August 4, 2022

            Some improvements have been made to the Docker node version. The new Docker images (one for Mainnet and one for Testnet) are designed for use with docker-compose or a similar driver. The node also requires a database which must be stored on the host system so that it persists when the Docker container is stopped.

            It is not mandatory but **strongly recommended** for Linux node runners to migrate to the new Docker distribution. The old Docker images will be deprecated and future node versions from 4.3 and upwards will only be provided in the new distribution.

        .. dropdown:: 4.2.3 - August 2, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.2.3 fixes a critical security vulnerability present in all previous 4.* node versions. All node runners **must** upgrade as soon as possible.

            The security advisory detailing the issue and the patch will be released on August 15th.

        .. dropdown:: 4.2.1 - June 27, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.2.1 is a maintenance release, bringing performance improvements and bugfixes. The highlights are:

            - A significant decrease in node startup time. The exact improvements are platform dependent, but startup should be at least 6 times faster on mainnet.
            - A significant decrease in node memory use. On mainnet, a 4.2.1 node should use less than 50% of memory compared to 4.1.1.
            - Reduced CPU use of passive nodes in Windows, Mac, and Linux distributions.

        .. dropdown:: 4.1.1 Sirius Testnet reset - June 13, 2022

            Sirius testnet has been reset on June 13, 2022.

            A new version of Concordium Node has been released to fix several critical errors related to delegation.

        .. dropdown:: 4.0.11 - May 16, 2022

            Concordium Node 4.0.11 introduces new functionality to support delegation to baker pools or passive delegation, and a new version Smart Contracts.

            V1 smart contracts includes the following key features:
            - Unlimited contract state size
            - Synchronous contract calls
            - Fallback entrypoints
            - An increased smart contract module size limit of 512kB
            - A number of cryptographic primitives

            Other improvements in this version include:
            - The SendTransaction function exposed via the gRPC interface now provides the caller with detailed error messages.
            - Support for wire-protocol version 0 is dropped, meaning that the node cannot connect to peers that do not support wire-protocol version 1, which is supported since version 1.1.0.
            - The macOS installer has been improved so it no longer overwrites the service files when reinstalling.
            - When using the Mac installer users now can leave one (but not both) of the net configurations empty when they don't want to configure a node for it. On the initial installation, leaving a net configuration empty means that the start/stop app shortcuts and the application support folder for that net won't be installed.
            - Consensus queries have been made more robust by validating input more extensively. This affects all queries whose input was a block or transaction hash. These queries now return an InvalidArgument error.
            - The maximum number of retries for Node Collector has been removed so it will keep querying indefinitely.
            - Nodes can now be stopped during out of band catchup by using the signals ``SIGINT`` and ``SIGTERM``.
            - The ``GetAccountInfo`` endpoint supports querying the account via the account index.
            - Baker pools and stake delegation are implemented for the P4 protocol version.
            - The new gRPC endpoint ``GetBakerList`` retrieves a JSON list of the baker IDs of the bakers registered in a known block. It returns null for an unknown block.
            - The new gRPC endpoint ``GetPoolStatus`` retrieves a status record for a baker pool, or for the set of passive delegators.
            - The bakerStakeThreshold level-2 keys are renamed to poolParameters keys; two additional access structures are defined: cooldownParameters and timeParameters.
            - Smart contract modules are cached on startup from the existing state to improve smart contract execution.

        .. dropdown:: 3.0.2 - April 21, 2022

            Fixed a security vulnerability in the network layer that could be used to crash the node, causing a denial of service.

        .. dropdown:: 3.0.1 - January 3, 2022

            Fixed a starvation bug in some cases of parallel node queries.

        .. dropdown:: 3.0.0 - November 29th 2021

            - Introduced support for account aliases via protocol P3. Accounts can be queried in ``GetAccountInfo``, ``GetAccountNonFinalizedTransactions``, ``GetNextAccountNonce`` by any alias.
            - ``GetAccountInfo`` object now has an additional field ``accountAddress`` that contains the canonical address of the account.
            - Fixed a bug due to incorrect use of LMDB database environments, where a node would crash if queried at specific times.
            - Faster state queries by avoiding locking the block state file when reading.
            - Fixed a bug caused by shutting down RPC before the node, which caused the node to crash when attempting a graceful shutdown while processing RPC requests.
            - The node now drops all connections on an unrecognized protocol update and refuses to accept new transactions.

        .. dropdown:: 1.1.3 - October 6, 2021

            The Concordium node release v1.1.3 is a bugfix release.

            - `Changelog <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#concordium-node-113>`__

        .. dropdown:: 1.1.2 - September 17, 2021

            The Concordium node release v1.1.2 is a bugfix release.

            - `Changelog <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#concordium-node-112>`__

        .. dropdown:: 1.1.1 - September 15, 2021

            The Concordium node release v1.1.1 implements a protocol update to add memo functionality for simple, shielded and scheduled transfers. This means that node runners **must upgrade** their nodes before the new protocol takes effect on testnet on September 22, 2021. Old nodes will stop processing new blocks at that point. See `protocol updates <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals>`_ for more details.

            - Added memo functionality for transactions to Protocol
            - Windows support for running a node
            - Mac support for running a node
            - Mac ARM M1 support for running a node

        .. dropdown:: 1.0.0 - May 12th, 2021

            Updated Open Testnet to match Mainnet features including:

            **Proof of Stake**

            The Concordium Blockchain uses a proof of stake mechanism to ensure resource-efficient operation of the network.

            **Two Layer Consensus Protocol**

            Nakamoto-Style Consensus Bakers participate in a form of lottery to win the right to append blocks to the chain.

            Finality Layer Concordium finality layer dynamically ‘checkpoints’ the blockchain using Byzantine agreement to identify and mark common blocks in the chains of honest users as final.

            **Built in IDLayer**

            Account creation is based on a validated identity, but at the same time it provides transactional privacy for users with a mechanism that allows accountability to local regulatory authorities.

            Transactional privacy is further enhanced by support for shielded transfers.

            **Smart Contracts**

            Concordium blockchain has native support for smart contracts on-chain with our core on-chain language WebAssembly (Wasm), a portable well-defined assembly-like language.

            Rust is the first off-chain high level smart contract language.

            **Tokenomics and On-chain Incentivization**

            The Concordium blockchain comprises a set of transactions and economic roles that interact within the economy. An economic role, such as a baker or account holder, is represented by an account on the Concordium platform.

            The flow of CCD between accounts via transactions creates an economy that is designed to incentivize participation in the network and counter dishonest behaviour. It is the objective of the Concordium Foundation to guide the creation of a sustainable economy that rewards participants for their efforts in developing the network.

            **Concordium Node**

            The Concordium node software is available for Linux and available in two different packages:

            * A distribution package, which provides wrappers for setting up the node in a Docker image.

            * A Debian package built for Ubuntu 20.04. This package allows for greater customization of the node set up.

        .. dropdown:: Open Testnet v4 update 1 - January 14th, 2020

            * Smart contracts support on chain
            * Rust supported as off-chain Smart Contract language
            * `Concordium-std <https://crates.io/crates/concordium-std>`_ library added for developing smart contracts in Rust.
            * ``Cargo-concordium`` tool for building and testing smart contracts off-chain
            * Documentation for smart contracts added to developer documentation
            * Smart Contract transactions added to ``concordium-client``


            Tokenomics (to match tokenomics model):

            * Rewards for baking and finalization changed
            * Minting changed
            * Extended the list of adjustable chain parameters
            * Updated `network dashboard block explorer <https://dashboard.testnet.concordium.com/chain>`_ to include new info
            * Amount lock-up transaction with schedule added
            * Staking changed so staked amount is locked
            * Mobile app updated to show staking and amount lockup schedules
            * Delegation removed

            ID layer:

            * Initial account creation added to ID provider process
            * Mobile app updated to support initial account creation

        .. dropdown:: Open Testnet v3 update 2 - October 16th, 2020

        .. dropdown:: 0.2.4 - April 2, 2020

            The Testnet v1 is the first public release of the Concordium Blockchain. Open Testnet aims at demonstrating the technology behind the Concordium Blockchain. This version is not feature-complete compared to the expected features for the first Mainnet version of the Concordium Blockchain.

            This release contains the following main features:

            -  Node software in a dockerized container featuring:

            -  *Passive node:* A node that participates in the Concordium
                network. It relays messages, provides an API for submitting
                transactions and inspecting the chain, and processes blocks, but
                does not produce any blocks on its own.
            -  *Baker node:* Does everything a passive node does, but in addition
                participates in consensus, producing blocks.
            -  *Finalizer node:* Does everything a baker node does, but in
                addition participates in the finalization part of our consensus.
            -  *Concordium Client:* A command-line interface to the Concordium
                Blockchain. Can send transactions and inspect the state of the
                node and the chain.
            -  Tools for interacting with the container

            -  A demo Web wallet

            -  Creating identities
            -  Creating accounts
            -  Making transfers
            -  Depositing CCD tokens
            -  Exporting identities and accounts

            -  A demo Identity service
            -  A Network `Dashboard <https://dashboard.testnet.concordium.com>`_

            Concordium will be running 19 nodes in Europe for this iteration of the Testnet
            and an additional node in Hong Kong (all running both baker and finalizer).

                - Show all options for importing an account.

        .. dropdown:: 6.0.1 - August 9, 2023

            Concordium Client 6.0.1 adds support for the upcoming `protocol version 6 <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals/blob/main/updates/P6.txt>`_ which is planned for release on Testnet August 21, 2023. **Note that this version of Concordium-Client requires at least node version 5.4.**

            - Removed a stray CTrue in output of ``consensus show-chain-parameters``.

            - Added ``raw GetNextUpdateSequenceNumbers`` subcommand.

            - Added node version to the output of ``raw GetNodeInfo``.

            - Print *Block time* instead of *Slot time* in the output of ``block show``.

            - In the output of ``consensus show-parameters``, election difficulty is only printed when present.

        .. dropdown:: 5.2.0 - June 1, 2023

            Concordium Client 5.2.0 contains the following features and bug fixes:

            - Fix a bug in display of ``consensus show-chain-parameters`` output for protocol version 6.

            - Add ``raw GetBlockTransactionEvents`` that prints the list of transaction outcomes in a given block.

        .. dropdown:: 5.1.1 - March 2, 2023

            Concordium Client has been migrated to use version 2 of the node gRPC API.

            - Since the node serves the V2 gRPC API on port 20000 by default, the default value of the `--grpc-port` option has been updated to reflect this.

            - Some `raw` commands have been removed and new `raw` commands have been added. For detailed information, see the `Concordium Client changelog <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-client/blob/main/ChangeLog.md#510>`__.

            - General improvements to error message information and phrasing.

            - The `--grpc-authentication-token` option has been removed.

        .. dropdown:: 5.0.2 - December 14, 2022

            Receive function parameters are now displayed as JSON in transaction status whenever they could be succesfully parsed by a smart contract schema embedded in the module or supplied by the user using the ``--schema`` option.

        .. dropdown:: 5.0.1 - November 21, 2022

            Concordium Client 5.0.1 adds support for the upcoming `protocol version 5 <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals/blob/main/updates/P5.txt>`_ which is planned for release on Testnet November 22, 2022.
            It also adds a ``--secure`` flag to enable connecting to gRPC using TLS. All commands that query the node support this.

            Additionally, it supports contract schema V3. V3 schemas offer the same options as V2, but also optionally includes a schema for contract events. `transaction status` now displays contract events, and a schema can be provided with `--schema`, which will be used to parse the contract events. By default events are parsed with the schema embedded in the contract, if present. This enables ``concordium-client`` to interact with contracts and schemas using `concordium-std` version 5. There is also improved formatting of `transaction status` output using contract schemas if they are available for displaying contract events, and output function parameters are shown as hex strings in `transaction status`.

        .. dropdown:: 4.2.0 - October 5, 2022

            - Fix handling of ``--no-confirm`` in ``contract init``, ``contract update``, ``module deploy``, and ``register data`` transactions. This flag is now respected.
            - Add support for import of keys from |bw|.
            - Fix some inconsistencies in the display format of CCD amounts.

        .. dropdown:: 4.1.0 - August 24, 2022

            - Fix bug in contract schema parsing caused by endiannes confusion.
            - Add support for smart contract schema V2. V2 schemas offer the same options as V1, but can also include a schema for the error type. This enables `concordium-client` to interact with contracts built using `concordium-std` version 4.

        .. dropdown:: 4.0.4 - August 4, 2022

            The `concordium-client` has been updated to better support the new smart contract v1 schema.

        .. dropdown:: 4.0.3 - June 15, 2022

            Concordium Client 4.0.3 supports version 1 Smart Contracts with the following changes.

            - A ``contract invoke`` command has been added for simulating contracts locally on the node.
            - Module deploy now expects modules with a version prefix. This prefix is added automatically when building with cargo-concordium version >= 2. The flag ``--contract-version`` has been added to support modules without the version prefix.
            - The ``contract update`` command now uses ``--entrypoint`` to specify the function to invoke. This is renamed from the previous ``--func``.
            - When calling ``contract update`` or ``contract invoke`` with a non-existent entrypoint the fallback entrypoint is called if one is specified in the contract.

            Concordium Client 4.0.3 also supports delegation to baker pools or passive delegation, and commands have been added to open baker pools.

            - The commands ``delegator add``, ``delegator configure`` and ``delegator remove`` have been added. Commands to support the baker opening a baker pool have also been added, including ``baker configure``, ``baker update-url`` and ``baker update-delegation-status``.
            - The existing commands ``baker add``, ``baker remove``, ``baker set-key``, ``baker update-restake`` and ``baker update-stake`` have been updated so that in Protocol version < 4, they generate the former P3 transaction, and in Protocol version 4, they generate the relevant ``configure baker`` transaction.
            - Support has been added for the raw queries ``GetPoolStatus`` and ``GetBakerList``.
            - The subcommand ``consensus show-chain-parameters`` has been added to show the chain parameters. This subcommand shows useful information, such as the amount needed to become a baker, bounding caps for baker pools, commission percentages for delegation, exchange rate parameters, and more.

        .. dropdown:: 3.0.4 - December 10, 2021

            - Credentials revealing the newly introduced attribute LEI can be deployed.
            - Renamed GTU token to CCD.
            - Renamed ``send-gtu``, ``send-gtu-scheduled`` and ``send-gtu-encrypted`` to ``send``, ``send-scheduled`` and ``send-shielded``.
            - Renamed ``account encrypt``/``decrypt`` to ``account shield``/``unshield``.
            - Added command for generating aliases of an address.
            - Now shows line breaks, tabs etc. in memo transfers (when it's CBOR encoded string), instead of escaping them as ``\n``, ``\t`` etc.
            - Now displays memo as JSON in a more readable way.
            - Added time units to slot duration and epoch duration in consensus status.
            - Updated the ``register-data`` command to register data as CBOR encoded strings or JSON using the new flags ``--string`` and ``--json``. Raw data can still be registered using the new flag ``--raw``.
            - Added ``raw DisconnectPeer``, a counterpart to the existing ``raw ConnectPeer``.
            - Now warning  the user when trying to add a baker with a stake below the minimum threshold.
            - Improved how contract schemas are shown as JSON:

            - Now displays complex types in arrays correctly.
            - Use angle brackets to indicate placeholders, e.g. ``"<UInt16>"`` instead of ``"UInt16"``.
            - Improved ``module inspect``:

            - Now shows all contracts from a module regardless of whether a schema is included or not.
            - Now shows the receive methods for contracts as well.
            - Now allows sending transactions where the sender is an account alias.

        .. dropdown:: 1.1.1 - October 6, 2021

            Added memo functionality for transactions

Smart contract Libraries
------------------------

    May 8, 2023

    Smart contract integration testing has been added to test your smart contracts: the `concordium-smart-contract-testing library <https://docs.rs/concordium-smart-contract-testing/latest/concordium_smart_contract_testing>`__ makes it possible to create and run automatic integration tests of smart contracts. This will allow a smart contract developer to write code that runs multiple contracts in a locally-controlled environment, interacts with them, and asserts that the eventual output and state of the contracts are as expected. For more information about how to enable this, see :ref:`Integration test a contract in Rust<integration-test-contract>`.
