Use your Ledger device with the Desktop Wallet
==============================================

Introduction
============
A Ledger device is a hardware wallet considered one of the most secure ways to store digital assets. It uses an offline method (also known as cold storage) for generating private keys, making it the preferred choice for many cryptocurrency users. This guide will help you connect your Ledger device to the Concordium Desktop Wallet. With this integration, you can send and receive CCD using your Ledger device.
