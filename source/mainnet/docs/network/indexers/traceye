Getting Started
---------------

Take a look at this SubQuery Starter Project that introduces SubQuery's Concordium support by indexing `Concordium <https://github.com/subquery/concordium-subql-starter/tree/main/Concordium/concordium-testnet-starter>`_.

You can also follow this `step-by-step guide <https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart.html>`_ to get familiar with SubQuery.

Running and Hosting your Concordium SubQuery APIs
-------------------------------------------------

SubQuery is open-source, meaning you have the freedom to run it in the following three ways:

- Locally on your own computer (or a cloud provider of your choosing), `view the instructions on how to run SubQuery Locally <https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html>`_.

- You can publish it to SubQuery's enterprise-level `Managed Service <https://managedservice.subquery.network/>`_, where SubQuery will host your SubQuery project in production-ready services for mission critical data with zero-downtime blue/green deployments. There is even a generous free tier. `Find out how <https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/publish.html>`_.

- You can publish it to the decentralized `SubQuery Network <https://subquery.network/network>`_, the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivized and verifiable way and supports Concordium from launch.
