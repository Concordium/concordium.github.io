===================================
Connect dApps to wallets
===================================

You can connect |cryptox| and |bw| to a `dApp <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application>`__ that has a frontend interface so that you can pay for services.
Connection can be made by either scanning a QR code or from a link to the dApp service.
Then, the dApp can initiate a request that you can confirm from within the wallet.

.. dropdown:: |cryptox|

   To connect your |cryptox| to a dApp:

   #. Tap the scan QR code button in the upper right of the main screen.
   #. When prompted to connect, tap **Allow** to continue using your account with the dApp.
