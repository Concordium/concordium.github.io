Support staking
===============

Concordium secures its network using a :term:`proof-of-stake` model enabling your users to earn rewards on their CCD holdings. This ecosystem is built on two key roles: :term:`validators<validator>`, who operate the nodes that run the network, and :term:`delegators<delegator>`, who are users that stake their CCD to support these validators.

For the majority of users, the primary way to participate is through :term:`delegation`. This allows them to assign the weight of their CCD to a validator of their choice, earning a share of the rewards without the technical overhead of running their own node.

Your wallet's role is to provide the essential interface for this process, enabling users to discover validators, delegate their funds securely, and manage their staking rewards.

Integrating these features provides a significant incentive for users to hold and interact with CCD within your application.
