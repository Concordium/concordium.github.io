Office Hours
=============

What Are Developer Office Hours?
--------------------------------

Office Hours are regular online sessions hosted by the Concordium team for developers and community members. During these sessions, you can ask questions, discuss technical challenges, and receive direct support from our team.

How Do On-Demand Office Hours Work?
-----------------------------------

Unlike pre-scheduled events, Office Hours are held only by community request. If you and at least two other participants express interest in a specific topic, we’ll be happy to organize a session.

All events are conducted as voice chats on our Discord server, and typically last around 1 hour.

What to Expect from Office Hours
--------------------------------

- Live discussion on the selected topic
- Answers from Concordium experts (developers, architects, DevRel)
- A space for sharing experiences and best practices
- Opportunity to ask technical questions live
