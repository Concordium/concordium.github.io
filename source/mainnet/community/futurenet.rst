Futurenet: The Future of Stablecoin Payments—Coming This April
==============================================================


🌟 What is Futurenet?
-------------------------
Futurenet is Concordium’s upcoming **Canary DevNet** to experiment 
with stablecoins at the **Protocol Layer**. 
Starting in April, our engineering team will begin deploying 
**releases every 2 weeks** to **Futurenet**—pushing new code *before* 
our Alpha goes live to testnet.

🙋 Why join Futurenet?
------------------------

- **Be among the first** to build and test newly released stablecoin payment products.
- Focus on **APIs** to quickly and seamlessly integrate stablecoin payments into existing payment solutions (Stripe, Shopify, etc).
- Your feedback will shape how we build Concordium’s stablecoins and guide the roadmap priorities.

💡 What can you do?
---------------------
**Futurenet** unlocks **powerful** new scenarios for **payment processing**, available only thanks for Concordium ID-layer:

1. **Geofencing Payments**

Conditional transactions based on geographic location, e.g., allowing payments only if the receiver is in the EU.

2. **Verify & Pay**

Enable age-restricted purchases by integrating identity verification directly into the payment process.

3. **Scheduled Transfers**

Automate periodic payments, like rent or subscriptions.

4. **Smart Payment Lock**

Execute transactions conditionally, e.g., payments triggered upon delivery or trade finance document verification.

📆 Launch Timeline
--------------------
* **22 April 2025**: Futurenet goes live; invite-only building begins!
* **Every 2 weeks**: New feature releases deployed.
* **June 2025**: First two scenarios (Geofenced Payments, Verify & Pay) delivered.
* **November 2025**: Delivery of second two scenarios (Scheduled Transfers and Smart Payment Locks).

🛠️ Who can apply?

* **Payment Pros**: Devs with experience with Stripe, WorldPay, Shopify, or similar platforms.
* **PayFi, Wallets & Stablecoin Integrators**: Teams already handling digital wallets, fiat on/off ramps, or stablecoin-based payment flows.
