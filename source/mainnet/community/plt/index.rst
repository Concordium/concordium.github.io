Protocol Layer Tokens (PLTs)
===========================

Protocol Layer Tokens (PLTs) are Concordium's native token standard built directly into the blockchain protocol layer. Unlike smart contract tokens, PLTs benefit from enhanced security, lower transaction costs, and direct integration with the Concordium identity layer.

Currently available on DevNet for testing and experimentation, PLTs enable new possibilities for digital assets on Concordium.
