What is DevNet?
===============

DevNet is an open, experimental Concordium network where the latest protocol features
and innovations are first introduced and tested before moving to more stable environments.

Our engineering team rolls out frequent updates across the entire development stack—from core protocol changes to SDKs and blockchain explorers—all for early testing.

.. note::
    DevNet is an unstable and experimental environment. The network may be updated and reset regularly,
    and APIs or data structures may change without backward compatibility.
    However, the Concordium team typically provides advance notice about planned resets
    or major updates.
