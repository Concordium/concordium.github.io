DevNet
======


What is DevNet?
---------------

DevNet is an open, experimental Concordium network where the latest protocol features
and innovations are first introduced and tested before moving to more stable environments.
Since April 2025, our engineering team has been rolling out frequent updates across the
entire development stack — from core protocol changes to SDKs, blockchain explorer,
and node software — all for early testing before reaching testnet and mainnet.

As of now, following the closed alpha testing phase, DevNet has become public and has entered the beta stage.
No application or invite is required — everyone is welcome to join and experiment with the available features!

.. note::
    DevNet is an unstable and experimental environment. The network may be updated and reset regularly,
    and APIs or data structures may change without backward compatibility.
    However, the Concordium team typically provides advance notice about planned resets
    or major updates, so users have time to prepare or save any important data.

Why join DevNet?
------------------------

- **Be among the first** to build and test newly released Concordium features and developments.
- Focus on **APIs** to quickly and seamlessly integrate stablecoin payments into existing payment solutions (Stripe, Shopify, etc).
- Your feedback will shape how we build Concordium’s stablecoins and guide the roadmap priorities.

What can you do?
----------------

Currently, the primary feature available for testing and building on DevNet is Protocol Level Tokens (PLTs).
If you want to be among the first to explore, experiment, or develop solutions with Concordium’s PLTs, DevNet is the place to do it.

    Read the PLT documentation :ref:`here<plts>`.

**DevNet** unlocks **powerful** new scenarios for **payment processing**, available only thanks for Concordium ID-layer:

1. **Geofencing Payments**

Conditional transactions based on geographic location, e.g., allowing payments only if the receiver is in the EU.

2. **Verify & Pay**

Enable age-restricted purchases by integrating identity verification directly into the payment process.

3. **Scheduled Transfers**

Automate periodic payments, like rent or subscriptions.

4. **Smart Payment Lock**

Execute transactions conditionally, e.g., payments triggered upon delivery or trade finance document verification.
