Contract development guides
===========================

The contract development guides help you get started writing smart contracts. Here you have guides to help you set up your tools, test your contract, and more.

Once you are familiar with smart contracts, it is a good idea to read the :ref:`Smart contracts best practices<sc-best-practices>`.

.. Note::

   To request CCDs for testing, use the buttons in the Concordium Wallets when running Testnet.
