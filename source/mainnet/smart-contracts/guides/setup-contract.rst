===================================
Setting up a smart contract project
===================================

This guide documents two different options (*from a template* or *from scratch*) to create a new Concordium smart contract project.
The *from a template* option is available for ``cargo-concordium`` version 2.2.0 or greater. It provides you with some
smart contract templates. Choose the template that best fits your project scope.
The *from scratch* option guides you through the process when you want to start a new project without any boilerplate code.

.. note::

   Concordium recommends that newcomers choose the *from a template* option.

From a template
===============

Concordium maintains several smart contract
`templates <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/templates>`_ (currently a ``default`` template and a ``cis2-nft`` template).
For generating the smart contracts from the above templates, the ``cargo-generate`` crate is required.
``cargo-generate`` can be installed by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $cargo install --locked cargo-generate

To start a new Concordium smart contract project from a template, run the command:

.. code-block:: console

   $cargo concordium init

The path where the project should be created can be provided with the ``--path`` option.

You can find additional information on the available templates in the
`README file <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/templates/README.md>`_.

From scratch
============

A smart contract in Rust is written as an ordinary Rust library crate.
The library is then compiled to Wasm using the Rust target
``wasm32-unknown-unknown`` and, since it is just a Rust library, you can use
Cargo_ for dependency management.

To set up a new smart contract project, first create a project directory. Inside
the project directory run the following in a terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   $cargo init --lib

This will set up a default Rust library project by creating a few files and
directories.
Your directory should now contain a ``Cargo.toml`` file and a ``src``
directory and some hidden files.

To be able to build Wasm you need to tell cargo the right ``crate-type``.
This is done by adding the following in the ``Cargo.toml`` file ::

   [lib]
   crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

Adding the smart contract standard library
==========================================

The next step is to add ``concordium-std`` as a dependency.
It is a library for Rust containing procedural macros and functions for
writing small and efficient smart contracts.

To add the library, open ``Cargo.toml`` and add the line
``concordium-std = "*"`` (preferably, replace the `*` with the latest version of `concordium-std`_) in
the ``[dependencies]`` section::

   [dependencies]
   concordium-std = "6.0"

The crate documentation is on docs.rs_.

.. note::

   If you wish to use a modified version of this crate, you will have to clone
   the repository with ``concordium-std`` and have the dependency point at the
   directory instead, by adding the following to ``Cargo.toml``::

      [dependencies]
      concordium-std = { path = "./path/to/concordium-std" }

.. _setup-wee-alloc-feature:

.. note::

   To compile your smart contracts, a memory `allocator <https://docs.rs/concordium-std/6.0.0/concordium_std/#use-a-custom-allocator>`_ is used.
   ``concordium-std`` version ``<6.0.0`` hard-coded the use of the `wee_alloc <https://docs.rs/wee_alloc/>`_ allocator.
   In ``concordium-std`` version ``>=6.0.0``, ``wee_alloc`` is a feature and needs to be explicitly enabled.
   When ``std`` feature is enabled the allocator provided by the Rust standard library is used
   by default but when the ``wee_alloc`` feature is enabled in addition, ``wee_alloc`` is used instead.

   You can enable the ``wee_alloc`` feature in ``concordium-std`` version ``>=6.0.0`` by using:

   .. code-block:: rust

      [dependencies]
      concordium-std = {version = "6.0", features = ["wee_alloc"]}

   Alternatively, if you want to test with and without ``wee_alloc`` enabled add a ``wee_alloc`` feature to the smart contract crate as follows:

   .. code-block:: rust

      [features]
      default = ["std", "wee_alloc"]
      std = ["concordium-std/std"]
      wee_alloc = ["concordium-std/wee_alloc"]

   The main reason for using ``wee_alloc`` instead of the default allocator
   is that ``wee_alloc`` has a smaller code footprint, i.e, the resulting smart contracts modules are going to
   be smaller. Smaller modules will be cheaper to deploy and run. Concordium nodes will load the smart contract module
   code into memory when executing a smart contract function on-chain. Hence, the smart contract module size
   has an impact on the execution cost.

.. note::

   ``Wee_alloc`` is unmaintained currently and hence an optional feature for backward compatibility.
   There are other allocators available, for example `dlmalloc <https://docs.rs/dlmalloc/>`_.

.. seealso::

   It is possible to build smart contracts without using Rust's ``std``.
   For more information, see :ref:`no-std`.
