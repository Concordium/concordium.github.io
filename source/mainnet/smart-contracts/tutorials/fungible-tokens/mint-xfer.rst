Mint, transfer, and burn fungible tokens
========================================

Now you are ready to mint your new tokens. Before minting, look at the minting parameters in the JSON file below. You need to specify the owner, then the token data following with its tokenID, metadata location on IPFS with the URL that you got when you uploaded the metadata file, hash value of it, amount to be minted, and maximum supply number. In this case, it uses tokenID ``01``, and mint ``110`` tokens initially with a maximum supply of 1000.

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "owner": {
            "Account": [
                "3AiAikC2v4H3Rv4L58oHvdX5N8LJoarsQwN3G7oNS7BoFsmt7N"
            ]
        },
        "tokens": [
            [
                "01",
                [
                    {
                        "url": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZBrF6HuoN12HyAznyk7gwFpnefooDbfxq3JeKTWToL1W",
                        "hash": "c00a140ea66af09c343083c0e7ccc77d5e0670d90014569798801bffad637d15"
                    },
                    {
                        "amount": "110",
                        "max_supply": "1000"
                    }
                ]
            ]
        ]
    }

Run the command below to call the contract ``mint()`` function. Remember that this is using the Concordium testnet node; if you are using your own node your command needs to be changed.

.. code-block:: console

    concordium-client contract update <YOUR-CONTRACT-INSTANCE> --entrypoint mint --parameter-json ../nft-artifacts/mint-params.json --schema dist/fungible/schema.bin --sender <YOUR-ACCOUNT> --energy 6000 --grpc-port 10000 --grpc-ip node.testnet.concordium.com

Now you have successfully minted your fungible tokens.

Check the state to see the balance and other stuff. Run the command below to invoke the ``view()`` function.

.. code-block:: console

    concordium-client contract invoke <YOUR-CONTRACT-INSTANCE> --entrypoint view --schema dist/fungible/schema.bin --grpc-port 10000 --grpc-ip node.testnet.concordium.com

.. image:: images/invoke-after-mint.png
    :width: 100%
    :alt: dark console screen with result of running the command above

Try to mint 900 more. You will receive an error because the maximum supply is 1000. It should be ok if you want to mint, at most, 890. Set the mint amount to 891 to test it out.

.. image:: images/error-maxsupplyreached.png

Unsurprisingly, you are not allowed to mint and it throws a custom error which was created by you in the ``MaxSupplyReached`` in your error enum.

Mint 500 more by adjusting the JSON file accordingly.

.. image:: images/mint-more.png
    :width: 100%
    :alt: dark console screen with result of running the command above

This was successful. Check the state once more by calling the ``view()`` function.

Transfer tokens
===============

Now you will test transferring some tokens to another account and checking the balances and the max/circulating supplies. Create a JSON file like the one below to set the transfer parameters. Transfer **11** tokens with the ID **01** to an account.

.. code-block:: JSON

    [
        {
            "token_id": "01",
            "amount": "11",
            "from": {
                "Account": [
                    "3AiAikC2v4H3Rv4L58oHvdX5N8LJoarsQwN3G7oNS7BoFsmt7N"
                ]
            },
            "to": {
                "Account": [
                    "4W59joBQavXqbyiKbPgBS7teZHDtEXsqx2BFUvPo2AzY3yPzeH"
                ]
            },
            "data": ""
        }
    ]

Run the command below to invoke the transfer. Remember that this is using the Concordium testnet node; if you are using your own node your command needs to be changed.

.. code-block:: console

    concordium-client contract update <YOUR-INDEX> --entrypoint transfer --parameter-json ../token-artifacts/transfer.json --schema dist/fungible/schema.bin --sender <YOUR-ACCOUNT> --energy 6000 --grpc-port 10000 --grpc-ip node.testnet.concordium.com

Check the state one more time to see that the transfer worked as expected.

Burn tokens
===========

Finally, burn some tokens. The amount will be deducted from the owner's account when the tokens are burned.

Before burning, check the state to see who owns what amount.

.. image:: images/check-before-burn.png
    :width: 100%
    :alt: dark console screen with result of running the command above

Create a JSON file for getting burn params like the one below. You need the token ID and the amount to be burned.

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "token_id": "01",
        "amount": "44"
    }

Burn 44 tokens from your first account. To do that, run the command below to call the ``burn()`` function.

.. code-block:: console

    concordium-client contract update <YOUR-INDEX> --entrypoint burn --parameter-json ../token-artifacts/burn.json --schema dist/fungible/schema.bin --sender <YOUR-ACCOUNT> --energy 6000 --grpc-port 10000 --grpc-ip node.testnet.concordium.com

.. image:: images/burn-tokens.png
    :width: 100%
    :alt: dark console screen with result of running the command above

And finally, check the state. Excellent! You have successfully burned 44 from the first account. In this case the circulating supply was not updated intentionally when someone burned a token; if you need that in your use case you will need to update the stateâ€™s ``burn`` function.
