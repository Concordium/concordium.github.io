You can go through a number of different tutorials to sharpen your skills as

It should allow any account to insert CCD and only the owner to smash it, taking all of the CCD inside.

In the ``wCCD`` tutorial, you are going to get familiar with the deployed wCCD token on testnet.
You are going to write a basic web front-end example that can read from and write to the deployed wCCD smart contract on testnet.
