.. _wCCD-interacting:

========================================
Interacting with the wCCD token protocol
========================================

.. note::

    Before you start with part 2 of this tutorial, make sure you have:

    - access to a testnet node

    - the ``concordium-client`` version 5.0.1 or greater installed

    - an account created in the mobile wallet app that is funded with some CCD

    - the keys from the Mobile Wallet imported into the ``concordium-client`` configuration

    If you haven't completed any of the above steps,
    the piggy bank tutorial :ref:`part 3 <piggy-bank-preparing>`
    will guide you through these setup steps.
    If you haven't completed any of the above steps, you can continue
    with :ref:`part 3 <wCCD-front-end-set-up>` of this tutorial. However, we recommend
    completing every part of this tutorial in the given order.
    You need an up-to-date ``concordium-client`` version because the wCCD smart contract uses the newest ``schema_V3``.

Query (non-state-mutative) functions
------------------------------------

The protocol has four query functions (``balanceOf``, ``operatorOf``, ``tokenMetadata``, and ``supports``)
that you can invoke on the wCCD contract. Because the ``schema`` is already embedded,
the input parameters can be provided with the ``--parameter-json`` flag.

.. note::

    The wCCD smart contract has its schemas embedded and you will not have to provide any schemas with the ``--schema`` flag.
    You can read more about schemas in this :ref:`section <contract-schema>`.

.. _balanceCCD:

Getting the CCD balance of an address
=====================================

.. dropdown:: Checking the CCD balance of an account (click here)

    You can check the CCD balance of an account on `CCDScan <https://testnet.ccdscan.io/>`_.

    .. image:: ./images/wCCD_tutorial_1.png
        :width: 100 %

    You can check the CCD balance of an account with this command:

    .. code-block:: console

        $./concordium-client account show ACCOUNT --grpc-port 10001

    .. image:: ./images/wCCD_tutorial_10.png
        :width: 100 %

.. dropdown:: Checking the CCD balance of a smart contract (click here)

    You can check the CCD balance of a smart contract with this command:

    .. code-block:: console

        $./concordium-client contract show INDEX --grpc-port 10001

    .. image:: ./images/wCCD_tutorial_3.png
        :width: 100 %

.. note::

    The smallest unit of CCD is 1 micro CCD and equals 10\ :sup:`−6` (one millionth) of a CCD.
    CCD has 6 decimal places. 1 CCD is represented by the balance
    value of 1,000,000 micro CCD on the blockchain and is worth the equivalent of a balance value of 1,000,000 micro wCCD.

.. _balanceOf:

The ``balanceOf`` function
==========================

.. dropdown:: Input parameters for the ``balanceOf`` function (click here)

    Create a ``balanceOf.json`` file and insert the following JSON array.

    .. code-block:: toml

        [
            {
                "address": {
                    "Enum": [
                        {
                            "Account": [
                                ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                            "Contract": [
                                {
                                    "index": INDEX,
                                    "subindex": SUBINDEX
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "token_id": TOKEN_ID
            }
        ]

    .. note::

        You can query the balance of several addresses in the above array.

    If you insert an account address correctly, the JSON array should look similar to the below JSON array.

    .. code-block:: json

        [
            {
                "address": {
                    "Account": [
                        "4phD1qaS3U1nLrzJcgYyiPq1k8aV1wAjTjYVPE3JaqovViXS4j"
                    ]
                },
                "token_id": ""
            }
        ]

    If you insert a smart contract address correctly, the JSON array should look similar to the below JSON array.

    .. code-block:: json

        [
            {
                "address": {
                    "Contract": [
                        {
                            "index": 844,
                            "subindex": 0
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "token_id": ""
            }
        ]

You are ready now to invoke the ``balanceOf`` function with the following command.

.. code-block:: console

    $./concordium-client contract invoke WCCD_CONTRACT_INDEX --entrypoint balanceOf --parameter-json balanceOf.json --grpc-port 10001

.. image:: ./images/wCCD_tutorial_4.png
    :width: 100 %

.. note::

    The smallest unit of CCD is 1 micro CCD and equals 10\ :sup:`−6` (one millionth) of a CCD.
    CCD has 6 decimal places. 1 CCD is represented by the balance
    value of 1,000,000 micro CCD on the blockchain and is worth the equivalent of a balance value of 1,000,000 micro wCCD.

.. _operatorOf:

The ``operatorOf`` function
===========================

.. dropdown:: Input parameters for the ``operatorOf`` function (click here)

    Create an ``operatorOf.json`` file and insert the following JSON array.

    .. code-block:: toml

        [
            {
                "address": {
                    "Enum": [
                        {
                            "Account": [
                                ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                            "Contract": [
                                {
                                    "index": INDEX,
                                    "subindex": SUBINDEX
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "owner": {
                    "Enum": [
                        {
                            "Account": [
                                ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                            "Contract": [
                                {
                                    "index": INDEX,
                                    "subindex": SUBINDEX
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]

    .. note::

        You can query several sets of addresses in the above array.

    If you insert everything correctly, the JSON array should look similar to
    the below JSON array.

    .. code-block:: json

        [
            {
                "address": {
                    "Account": [
                        "4DH219BXocxeVByKpZAGKNAJx7s2w1HFpwaNu1Ljd1mXFXig22"
                    ]
                }
                "owner": {
                    "Account": [
                        "4phD1qaS3U1nLrzJcgYyiPq1k8aV1wAjTjYVPE3JaqovViXS4j"
                    ]
                },
            }
        ]

You are ready now to invoke the ``operatorOf`` function with the following command.

.. code-block:: console

    $./concordium-client contract invoke WCCD_CONTRACT_INDEX --entrypoint operatorOf --parameter-json operatorOf.json --grpc-port 10001

.. image:: ./images/wCCD_tutorial_7.png
    :width: 100 %

The ``tokenMetadata`` function
==============================

.. dropdown:: Input parameters for the ``tokenMetadata`` function (click here)

    Create a ``tokenMetadata.json`` file and insert the following JSON array.

    .. code-block:: json

        [""]

    .. note::

        This empty string is required because of the CIS-2 token standard.
        The `tokenId` of the wCCD token is the smallest unit possible (an empty string).

You are ready now to invoke the ``tokenMetadata`` function with the following command.

.. code-block:: console

    $./concordium-client contract invoke WCCD_CONTRACT_INDEX --entrypoint tokenMetadata --parameter-json tokenMetadata.json --grpc-port 10001

.. image:: ./images/wCCD_tutorial_8.png
    :width: 100 %

The ``supports`` function
=========================

.. dropdown:: Input parameters for the ``supports`` function (click here)

    Create a ``supports.json`` file and insert the following example JSON array. It will query if
    the two token standards (``CIS-0`` and ``CIS-2``) are supported by the wCCD token.

    .. code-block:: json

        ["CIS-0","CIS-2"]

    .. note::

        You can find more information about the `CIS-0 standard <https://proposals.concordium.software/CIS/cis-0.html>`_
        and the `CIS-2 standard <https://proposals.concordium.software/CIS/cis-2.html>`_.

You are ready now to invoke the ``supports`` function with the following command.

.. code-block:: console

    $./concordium-client contract invoke WCCD_CONTRACT_INDEX --entrypoint supports --parameter-json supports.json --grpc-port 10001

The below screenshot shows the response of querying if the wCCD
token contract supports the following standards
``["12345","CIS-0","CIS-2"]``. Its response is that it does
not support the standard ``12345`` but it supports the ``CIS-0`` and the ``CIS-1`` standards.

.. image:: ./images/wCCD_tutorial_9.png
    :width: 100 %

State-mutative functions
------------------------

The protocol has four state-mutative functions (``wrap``, ``unwrap``,
``transfer``, and ``updateOperator``) that you can invoke on the wCCD smart contract.
Because the ``schema`` is already embedded,
the input parameters can be provided with the ``--parameter-json`` flag.

.. note::

    The wCCD smart contract has its schemas embedded and you will not have to provide any schemas with the ``--schema`` flag.
    You can read more about schemas in this :ref:`section <contract-schema>`.

The ``wrap`` function
=====================

Wrapping CCD refers to the process of converting the native currency CCD into
a ``CIS-2`` compliant token (wCCD) at a 1:1 ratio by sending CCD to the wCCD smart
contract and getting wCCD in return.
You can specify with the ``--amount`` flag how much CCD you want to wrap.

Create a ``wrap.json`` file and insert the JSON object
from option 1 (Receiver is an account) or option 2 (Receiver is a smart contract).

.. dropdown:: Option 1 (Receiver is an account) (click here)

    .. code-block:: toml

        {
            "data": DATA_STRING,
            "to": {
                "Account": [
                    ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
                ]
            }
        }

    The ``DATA_STRING`` is only relevant if wCCD is sent to a smart contract as described in option 2.
    You can use your account address if you want to credit the wCCD to your own account.
    If you insert your account address correctly, the JSON object should look similar to the below JSON object.

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "data": "",
            "to": {
                "Account": [
                    "4phD1qaS3U1nLrzJcgYyiPq1k8aV1wAjTjYVPE3JaqovViXS4j"
                ]
            }
        }

.. dropdown::  Option 2 (Receiver is a smart contract) (click here)

    .. code-block:: toml

        {
            "data": DATA_STRING,
            "to": {
                "Contract": [
                    {
                        "index": INDEX,
                        "subindex": SUBINDEX
                    },
                    ENTRYPOINT_NAME
                ]
            }
        }

    Some additional bytes (encoded as a lowercase hex string called ``DATA_STRING``)
    are used in the ``OnReceivingCis2`` hook. This hook is executed only if the ``to`` address is a
    contract and the ``to`` address is not the invoker of the ``wrap`` function.
    The ``OnReceivingCis2`` hook invokes the ``ENTRYPOINT_NAME`` on the smart contract ``INDEX`` with
    the ``OnReceivingCis2Params`` parameters which include the above ``DATA_STRING``.
    This action allows the receiving smart contract to
    react to the credited wCCD amount. You can keep the data field empty
    if you don't want to send any additional data to the receiving smart contract.

    .. note::

        In programming, a ``hook`` is an interface provided in packaged code
        that allows a programmer to insert customized programming code to either
        provide a different behavior or to react when something happens.
        The ``OnReceivingCis2`` hook allows a smart contract developer to code a
        smart contract A that taps into the ``transfer`` or ``wrap`` functions of the wCCD smart
        contract. Smart contract A can insert some custom logic/behavior if the ``transfer`` or ``wrap`` functions
        are invoked and would result in the smart contract A getting credited some wCCD.

        The ``ENTRYPOINT_NAME`` is an attribute that is added above each function
        in the smart contract code as shown below using the example entrypoint name ``receiveToken``.

        .. code-block:: rust

            #[receive(contract = "contractName", name = "receiveToken")]
            fn contract_receive_Token<S: HasStateApi>( ... ) ... { ... }

    You can use the smart contract deployed at index 844 on testnet and
    its function entry point name ``receiveToken`` for testing.

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "data": "",
            "to": {
                "Contract": [
                    {
                        "index": 844,
                        "subindex": 0
                    },
                    "receiveToken"
                ]
            }
        }

Before you execute the ``wrap`` function, check
the CCD balance of your ``SENDER_ACCOUNT`` (the account that initiates the transaction) and the wCCD smart contract as described :ref:`here <balanceCCD>`.
The ``wrap`` function will send some CCD from your ``SENDER_ACCOUNT`` account to the wCCD smart contract contract.

.. note::

    This tutorial is also used by other people and they might at the same
    time interact with the smart contracts and change their CCD or wCCD balances.

Before you execute the ``wrap`` function, check
the wCCD balance of the ``to`` address with the :ref:`balanceOf <balanceOf>` function.
The ``to`` address will receive some wCCD
because the ``wrap`` function will credit some wCCD to the ``to`` address.

You are ready now to wrap your CCD into wCCD with the following command.
The ``--energy`` flag specifies the maximum amount of NRG to be spent on the transaction
and can be used to set an upper limit of the transaction fee that you are
willing to spend when interacting with the blockchain.

.. code-block:: console

    $./concordium-client contract update WCCD_CONTRACT_INDEX --entrypoint wrap --parameter-json wrap.json --amount AMOUNT --sender SENDER_ACCOUNT --energy 25000 --grpc-port 10001

The below screenshot shows the wrapping of 1 CCD (1,000,000 micro CCDs) into 1,000,000 micro wCCD.

.. image:: ./images/wCCD_tutorial_2.png
    :width: 100 %

Confirm that the CCD balance of the ``SENDER_ACCOUNT`` was decreased
by ``AMOUNT`` and that the CCD balance of the wCCD smart contract contract was increased by ``AMOUNT``.

.. note::

    Keep in mind that the ``SENDER_ACCOUNT`` also paid some CCD as transaction fees.
    The amount of transaction fees can be seen as shown in the above screenshot.

Confirm that the wCCD balance of the ``to`` address increased by ``AMOUNT``.

The ``unwrap`` function
=======================

Unwrapping CCD refers to the opposite process of converting the ``CIS-2``
compliant wCCD token at a 1:1 ratio back to the native currency CCD by burning the
wCCD token in the wCCD smart contract and getting CCD in return.

.. dropdown:: Input parameters for the ``unwrap`` function (click here)

    Create an ``unwrap.json`` file and insert the below JSON object.

    .. code-block:: toml

        {
            "amount": AMOUNT,
            "data": DATA_STRING,
            "owner": {
                "Enum": [
                    {
                        "Account": [
                            ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Contract": [
                            {
                                "index": INDEX,
                                "subindex": SUBINDEX
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "receiver": {
                "Enum": [
                    {
                        "Account": [
                            ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Contract": [
                            {
                                "index": INDEX,
                                "subindex": SUBINDEX
                            },
                            ENTRYPOINT_NAME
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        }

    If you insert everything correctly, the JSON object should look similar to
    the below JSON object that will unwrap 1,000,000 micro wCDD from an account
    and send the received CCDs back to the same account.

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "amount": "1000000",
            "data": "",
            "owner": {
                "Account": [
                    "4phD1qaS3U1nLrzJcgYyiPq1k8aV1wAjTjYVPE3JaqovViXS4j"
                ]
            },
            "receiver": {
                "Account": [
                    "4phD1qaS3U1nLrzJcgYyiPq1k8aV1wAjTjYVPE3JaqovViXS4j"
                ]
            }
        }

Before you execute the ``unwrap`` function, check
the CCD balance of the ``receiver`` address and the wCCD smart contract as described :ref:`here <balanceCCD>`.
The ``unwrap`` function will send some CCD from the wCCD smart contract to the ``receiver`` address.

Before you execute the ``unwrap`` function, check
the wCCD balance of the ``owner`` address with the :ref:`balanceOf <balanceOf>` function.
The ``owner`` address will get its wCCD balance reduced
because the ``unwrap`` function will burn some wCCD from the ``owner`` address.

The ``owner`` has to have at least a balance of ``AMOUNT`` in wCCD tokens
and the ``SENDER_ACCOUNT`` has to be the ``owner`` address or be an ``operator`` of the ``owner`` address.
You are ready now to unwrap your wCCD into CCD with the following command.

.. code-block:: console

    $./concordium-client contract update WCCD_CONTRACT_INDEX --entrypoint unwrap --parameter-json unwrap.json --sender SENDER_ACCOUNT --energy 25000 --grpc-port 10001

The below screenshot shows the execution of the ``unwrap`` function.

.. image:: ./images/wCCD_tutorial_11.png
    :width: 100 %

Confirm that the CCD balance of the ``receiver`` was increased
by ``AMOUNT`` (specified in the ``unwrap.json`` file) and that the CCD
balance of the wCCD smart contract was decreased by ``AMOUNT``.

Confirm that the wCCD balance of the ``owner`` address decreased by ``AMOUNT`` specified in the ``unwrap.json`` file.

The ``transfer`` function
=========================

You can transfer the wCCD tokens from one address to another address.

.. dropdown:: Input parameters for the ``transfer`` function (click here)

    Create a ``transfer.json`` file and insert the below JSON array.

    .. code-block:: toml

        [
            {
                "amount": AMOUNT,
                "data": DATA_STRING,
                "from": {
                    "Enum": [
                        {
                            "Account": [
                                ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                            "Contract": [
                                {
                                    "index": INDEX,
                                    "subindex": SUBINDEX
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "to": {
                    "Enum": [
                        {
                            "Account": [
                                ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                            "Contract": [
                                {
                                    "index": INDEX,
                                    "subindex": SUBINDEX
                                },
                                ENTRYPOINT_NAME
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "token_id": TOKEN_ID
            }
        ]

    .. note::

        You can execute several transfers in the above array.

    If you insert everything correctly, the JSON array should look similar to
    the below JSON array that will transfer 1 micro wCCD from an account address to another account address.

    .. code-block:: json

        [
            {
                "amount": "1",
                "data": "",
                "from": {
                    "Account": [
                        "4phD1qaS3U1nLrzJcgYyiPq1k8aV1wAjTjYVPE3JaqovViXS4j"
                    ]
                },
                "to": {
                    "Account": [
                        "4DH219BXocxeVByKpZAGKNAJx7s2w1HFpwaNu1Ljd1mXFXig22"
                    ]
                },
                "token_id": ""
            }
        ]

Before you execute the ``transfer`` function, check
the wCCD balance of the ``from`` address and the ``to`` address with the :ref:`balanceOf <balanceOf>` function.
The ``transfer`` function will send some wCCD from the ``from`` address to the ``to`` address.

The ``from`` address has to have at least a balance of ``AMOUNT`` in wCCD tokens
and the ``SENDER_ACCOUNT`` has to be the ``from`` address or be an ``operator`` of the ``from`` address.
You are ready now to transfer your wCCD to another address with the following command.

.. code-block:: console

    $./concordium-client contract update WCCD_CONTRACT_INDEX --entrypoint transfer --parameter-json transfer.json --sender SENDER_ACCOUNT --energy 25000 --grpc-port 10001

The below screenshot shows the execution of the ``transfer`` function.

.. image:: ./images/wCCD_tutorial_5.png
    :width: 100 %

Confirm that the wCCD balance of the ``to`` address was increased
by ``AMOUNT`` (specified in the ``transfer.json`` file) and that the wCCD
balance of the ``from`` address was decreased by ``AMOUNT``.

The ``updateOperator`` function
===============================

You can add one or more operator addresses to an address that you control.
These operators have access to your wCCD tokens
at that address and can transfer or unwrap them on your behalf.
You should only add operator addresses that you trust. The ``updateOperator`` function allows you
to add and remove operators.
For example, a smart contract address is often added as an operator so it can
access your tokens to perform some smart contract operations
without you having to interact with the smart contract again.

.. dropdown:: Input parameters for the ``updateOperator`` function (click here)

    Create an ``updateOperator.json`` file and insert the below JSON array.

    .. code-block:: toml

        [
            {
                "operator": {
                    "Enum": [
                        {
                            "Account": [
                                ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                            "Contract": [
                                {
                                    "index": INDEX,
                                    "subindex": SUBINDEX
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "update": {
                    "Enum": [
                        {
                            "Remove": []
                        },
                        {
                            "Add": []
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]

    .. note::

        You can add/remove several operator addresses in the above array.

    If you insert everything correctly, the JSON array should look similar to
    the below JSON array that will add the account address 4DH219B... as
    an operator to the ``SENDER_ACCOUNT``.

    .. code-block:: json

        [
            {
                "operator": {
                    "Account": [
                        "4DH219BXocxeVByKpZAGKNAJx7s2w1HFpwaNu1Ljd1mXFXig22"
                    ]
                },
                "update":
                {
                    "Add": []
                }
            }
        ]

Before you execute the ``updateOperator`` function, check
the state of the smart contract with the :ref:`operatorOf <operatorOf>` function.

You are ready now to update the operator on your ``SENDER_ACCOUNT`` address with the following command.

.. code-block:: console

    $./concordium-client contract update WCCD_CONTRACT_INDEX --entrypoint updateOperator --parameter-json updateOperator.json --sender SENDER_ACCOUNT --energy 25000 --grpc-port 10001

The below screenshot shows the execution of the ``updateOperator`` function.

.. image:: ./images/wCCD_tutorial_6.png
    :width: 100 %

Confirm that the ``updateOperator`` function has added/removed operator addresses by checking
with the ``operatorOf`` function the state of the smart contract again.
