============================
Running your first full dApp
============================

You are running your own local dApp now. If you want, you can compare it with our
`wCCD dApp <https://wccd.testnet.concordium.com/>`_ hosted on testnet. You can use your |bw|
to connect to the dApp.

.. note::

    The |bw| is connected to the testnet.
    You have an identity and account in your wallet loaded.
    You can find more information on how to set up the |bw| in :ref:`part 3 <wCCD-front-end-set-up>` or :ref:`Setup the Concordium Wallet for web<setup-browser-wallet>`.

Congratulations. You have completed the whole wCCD tutorial.
