The wCCD smart contract
=======================

In this tutorial, you are going to get familiar with the deployed wCCD token on testnet.
You are going to write a basic web front-end example that can read from and write to the deployed wCCD smart contract on testnet.

In the :ref:`first part<wCCD-introduction>`, you will learn more about the wCCD token protocol.

In the :ref:`second part<wCCD-interacting>`, you will interact with the wCCD token protocol using the ``concordium-client``.

In the :ref:`third part<wCCD-front-end-set-up>`, you will download the browser wallet and set up a basic web front-end locally.

In the :ref:`fourth part<wCCD-full-dApp>`, you will interact with the wCCD token protocol using your local front-end.

.. warning::

   The reader is assumed to have basic knowledge of what a blockchain and smart
   contracts are, and some experience with web front-end development.
