The wCCD smart contract
=======================

In this tutorial, you are going to get familiar with the deployed wCCD token on testnet.
You will write a basic front-end example that can read and write to the deployed wCCD smart contract on testnet.

In the :ref:`first part<wCCD-logic>`, you will learn the logic of the wCCD token contract to understand how a
front-end should invoke the functions.

.. warning::

   The reader is assumed to have basic knowledge of what a blockchain and smart
   contracts are, and some experience with front-end development.
