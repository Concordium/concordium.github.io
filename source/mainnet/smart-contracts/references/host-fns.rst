.. _host-functions:

=======================
Contract host functions
=======================
This is a reference of the functions in the ``concordium`` module supplied by a
host running smart contract Wasm module.

.. warning::

   These functions are not meant to be called directly by smart contract writers.
   Instead, they are to be used behind a more idiomatic, language-specific API
   supplied by a library, such as `concordium-std`_ for Rust.

.. module:: concordium

.. _host-functions-log:

Logging events
==============

.. function:: log_event(start, length) -> i32

   Adds a log item from an array of bytes.
   If not enough data can be read then this function will trap and abort
   execution of the smart contract.

   :param i32 start: Pointer to the start of the item in Wasm linear memory.
   :param i32 length: Number of bytes in the item.

   :return: ``-1`` if logging failed because the message was too long.
            ``0`` if the log is already full.
            ``1`` if the data was successfully logged.
   :rtype: i32

Function parameter
==================

.. function:: get_parameter_size(i) -> i32

   Get the byte size of the ``i``-th parameter to the call. The 0-th parameter is
   always the original parameter that the method was invoked with. Invoking
   other contracts with ``invoke`` adds additional parameters to the stack.

   :param i32 i: Index of the parameter.
   :return: Byte size of the ``i``-th parameter or ``-1`` if the parameter
            doesn't exist.
   :rtype: i32

.. function:: get_parameter_section(i, location, length, offset) -> i32

   Read a section of the ``i``-th parameter to the given location in Wasm linear memory.
   Return the number of bytes read.
   The location is assumed to contain enough memory to write the requested
   length into. If not, the function will trap and abort execution of
   the contract.

   :param i32 i: Index of the parameter.
   :param i32 location: Pointer to the write location in Wasm linear memory.
   :param i32 length: Number of bytes to read from the parameter.
   :param i32 offset: Starting offset in the parameter bytes.
   :return: The number of actual bytes read. This is always less than or equal
            to ``length``. It is less if the parameter does not have
            enough bytes available (i.e., if ``offset + length >
            parameter_size``). Returns ``-1`` if the parameter does not exist.
   :rtype: i32

.. _host-functions-state:

Smart contract instance state
=============================

.. function:: state_create_entry(key_start, key_length) -> i64

    Create an empty entry with the given key.
    If an entry at that key already exists it is set to the empty entry.

    :param i32 key_start: Pointer to a key, represented as a bytearray in the Wasm
                          memory.
    :param i32 key_length: The length of the key.
    :return: The return value is either ``2^64 - 1`` if creating the entry failed
             because of an iterator lock on the part of the tree, or else the
             first bit is ``0``, and the remaining bits are an *entry
             identifier* that maybe used in subsequent state-related calls.
    :rtype: i64

.. function:: state_lookup_entry(key_start, key_length) -> i64

    Lookup an entry with the given key.

    :param i32 key_start: Pointer to key, represented as a bytearray in the Wasm
                          memory.
    :param i32 key_length: The length of the key.
    :return: The return value is either ``2^64 - 1`` if creating the entry failed
             because of an iterator lock on the part of the tree, or else the
             first bit is ``0`` and the remaining bits are an *entry
             identifier* that maybe used in any of the entry calls.
    :rtype: i64

.. function:: state_delete_entry(key_start, key_length) -> i32

    Delete the entry.

    :param i32 key_start: Pointer to a key, represented as a byte array in the Wasm
                          memory.
    :param i32 key_length: The length of the key.
    :return: Returns ``0`` if the part of the tree this entry was in is *locked*
             by an iterator (see the |state_iterate_prefix|_ for details) and
             the deletion thus failed.
             Returns ``1`` if the entry didn't exist. Return ``2`` if the entry
             was successfully deleted.
    :rtype: i32

.. function:: state_delete_prefix(key_start, key_length) -> i32

    the given key as a prefix.

                          memory.
    :param i32 key_length: The length of the key.
    :return: Returns ``0`` if the tree is *locked*
             by an iterator (see the |state_iterate_prefix|_ for details) and
             the deletion thus failed.
             Returns ``1`` if the tree *was not locked*, but the key points to
             an empty part of the tree.
             Returns ``2`` if a part of the tree was successfully deleted.
    :rtype: i32

.. function:: state_iterate_prefix(prefix_start, prefix_length) -> i64

    Construct an iterator over a part of the tree. This **locks the part of
    the tree that has the given prefix**. Locking means that no
    deletions or insertions of entries may occur in that subtree.

    :param i32 key_start: Pointer to a prefix, represented as a byte array in the Wasm
                          memory.
    :param i32 key_length: The length of the prefix.
    :return: Returns all 1 bits if too many iterators already exist with this key.
             Returns all but second bit set to 1 if there is no value in the
             state with given prefix.
             Otherwise, the first bit is 0, and the remaining bits are the
             *iterator identifier* that may be used in subsequent calls to
             advance it, or to get its key.
    :rtype: i64

.. function:: state_iterator_next(iterator) -> i64

   Return the next entry along the iterator, and advance the iterator.

   :param i64 iterator: An iterator identifier, as returned by |state_iterate_prefix|_.

            or the identifier was invalid).
            Returns all but the second bit set to 1 if no more entries are left,
            i.e., the iterator is exhausted. All further calls will yield the
            same value until the iterator is deleted.
            Otherwise, the first bit is 0, and the remaining bits encode an
            *entry identifier* that may be with any of the entry methods.
   :rtype: i64

.. function:: state_iterator_delete(iterator) -> i32

   Delete the iterator, unlocking the subtree.

   :rtype: i32

.. function:: state_iterator_key_read(iterator, start, length, offset) -> i32

   Read a section of the key the iterator is currently pointing at.
   Before the first call to the |state_iterator_next|_ function this returns
   (sections of) the key that was used to create the iterator. After
   the iterator is exhausted, this method returns (sections of) the key at the
   first node returned by the iterator.

   :param i64 iterator: An iterator identifier, as returned by |state_iterate_prefix|_.
   :param i32 start: A pointer to a location in the Wasm memory where the key
                     section be written to.
   :param i32 length: Number of bytes to read from the key.
   :param i32 offset: Starting offset in the key bytes.

            ``0x09_0000_0000`` if failed because of module being an unsupported smart contract version.

            No other values are possible.

   differ.

   :param i32 start: Pointer to the location to put the entrypoint name.
