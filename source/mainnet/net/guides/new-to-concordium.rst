Getting started with Concordium
===============================

.. dropdown:: I want to learn more about the Concordium concepts

    Read about our project on `concordium.com <https://www.concordium.com>`_.

    Read about the various concepts

    - :ref:`Identities<reference-id-accounts>`
    - :ref:`Accounts<managing_accounts>`

.. dropdown:: I want to run a node

    See the :ref:`node requirements<node-requirements>`.

    I want to run a node on:

    - :ref:`Docker<docker-node>`
    - :ref:`Linux/ubuntu<ubuntu-node>`
    - :ref:`Windows<windows-node>`
    - :ref:`Mac<macos-node>`

.. dropdown:: I want to stake CCD to earn more CCD

    The staking options on Concordium are :ref:`baking or delegating<how-to-earn>`. To be a baker you must run a node and have a minimum of 14000 CCDs in an account. There is no minimum amount of CCDs needed to delegate.

    - I want to :ref:`learn more about baking and delegating<delegation-faq>` before continuing.
    - I have enough funds to :ref:`be a baker<overview-baker>`.
    - I only want to :ref:`delegate to a baker pool or passive delegation<add-delegation>`.

.. dropdown:: I want to build a dApp that uses Concordium's ID layer

    See the tutorial for a :ref:`gallery that uses ID proofs for access<gallery>`.

.. dropdown:: I want to learn about smart contracts at Concordium

    Start with an :ref:`introduction to smart contracts<introduction>`.

.. dropdown:: I want to write a smart contract

    Start by setting up the tools needed to write smart contracts. Concordium uses Rust as the language for smart contracts. :ref:`This guide<setup-env>` lists all the tools and environments needed to write smart contracts.

    Once you have set up the tools, you can write your contract.
