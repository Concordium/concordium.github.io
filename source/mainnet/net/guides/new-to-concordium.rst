Getting started with Concordium
===============================

.. dropdown:: I want to learn more about the Concordium concepts

    Read about our project on concordium.com

    Read about the various concepts

        - Identities
        - Accounts
        - Delegation
        - Baking

    Use the glossary of terms to learn the language

.. dropdown:: I want to learn more about Concordium wallets

    - I'm not sure what kind of wallet I want
    - I want a web wallet
    - I want a wallet for my Android phone
    - I want a wallet for my iOS phone
    - I want a wallet I can run on my desktop that uses a hardware wallet

.. dropdown:: I want to run a node

    See the node requirements.

    I want to run a node on:

    - Docker
    - Linux/ubuntu
    - Windows
    - Mac

.. dropdown:: I want to stake CCD to earn more CCD

    The staking options on Concordium are baking or delegating. To be a baker you must run a node and have a minimum of 14000 CCDs in an account. There is no minimum amount of CCDs needed to delegate.

    - I want to learn more about baking and delegating before continuing.
    - I have enough funds to be a baker.
    - I only want to delegate to a baker pool.

.. dropdown:: I want to build a dApp that uses Concordium's ID layer

    See the tutorial for a gallery that uses ID proofs for access.

.. dropdown:: I want to learn about smart contracts at Concordium

    Start with an introduction to smart contracts.

.. dropdown:: I want to write a smart contract

    Start by setting up the tools needed to write smart contracts. Concordium uses Rust as the language for smart contracts. This guide lists all the tools and environments needed to write smart contracts.

    Once you have set up the tools, you can write your contract.
