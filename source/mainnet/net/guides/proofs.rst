===============================
Proofs and revealing attributes
===============================

Some dApps or services may require you to prove that you are over a certain age, or that you reside in a specific range of countries or area. You can choose whether you want to reveal these :ref:`attributes<glossary-attribute>` to the dApp or service. The dApp or service uses a :ref:`secret proof<glossary-secret-proof>` to request the attribute(s) necessary for their service.

.. Warning::

    When you reveal information to a third party, you effectively hand over your information to them. This means that you should only do this, if you have absolute trust in them, and if you are familiar with their data usage and protection procedures.

==================================

When the wallet receives a request, you see a screen similiar to below.
