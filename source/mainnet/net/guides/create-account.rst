Create an account
=================

If you created your :ref:`identity<glossary-identity>` for Desktop Wallet and |mw-gen1|, it came with an :ref:`initial account<glossary-initial-account>`. The initial account is a special account that the :ref:`identity provider<glossary-identity-provider>` submits to the chain. When you already have an identity, you can create more :ref:`accounts<glossary-account>` with that identity yourself.

If you are using |mw-gen2|, you created your :ref:`identity<glossary-identity>` during setup. Once you have an identity, you can create :ref:`accounts<glossary-account>` with that identity.

To learn more about identities and accounts, see :ref:`Identities <reference-id-accounts>` and :ref:`Accounts <managing_accounts>`.

            .. note::
                You can't import accounts that were created on |mw-gen2| or |mw-gen1|.

        Before you create more accounts, you need a Ledger hardware wallet with the Concordium Ledger App installed. See :ref:`Set up the Ledger device and install the Concordium Ledger App<install-ledger-app>`.

        #. Go to **Accounts**. You can now see all the accounts that you're the custodian of.

        8. Wait for the message in the Desktop Wallet saying **Ledger Nano S is ready** or **Ledger Nano S Plus is ready** and select **Submit**.

            - Public key: Press both buttons to accept.

        10. Verify that the public key on the Ledger corresponds to the public key in the Desktop Wallet. Use the right button to navigate through the key.

        11. Press both buttons to confirm, and then in the Desktop Wallet, select **Continue**.

        12. The Ledger says **Review details**. Press both buttons, and then press the right button to navigate through the public key and verify that it corresponds to the information in the Desktop Wallet. Press both buttons to confirm.

        13. Verify that the signature threshold on the Ledger corresponds to the threshold in the Desktop Wallet.

        14.  Press the right button to verify that the anonymity revoker threshold on the Ledger corresponds to the threshold in the Desktop Wallet, and then press both buttons.

        15. The Ledger says **Sign details**. Press both buttons to sign the transaction. In the Desktop Wallet you can now see the that the account has been submitted to the blockchain.

        16. Select **Finished**. Your new account is now listed along with the other accounts you're the custodian of.
