===================
Recover your Wallet
===================

In case you get a new device or need to restore your existing device, you can recover your identities, accounts, and keys with the secret recovery phrase you wrote down during wallet setup.

.. Note::

    You cannot recover testnet wallets on mainnet, or vice versa.

.. Note::

    The recovery process for Desktop Wallet and |mw-gen1| is different. For information about these, see :ref:`Make a backup of identities, accounts, and addresses<export-import>`.

.. dropdown:: |cryptox|

.. dropdown:: |bw|

    #. After :ref:`reinstalling<setup-bw>` the |bw|, open the extension, create a passcode, and when prompted, choose **Restore**.

    #. Enter your 24 word secret recovery phrase. Click **Continue**.

    #. Select whether to recover your wallet in Mainnet or Testnet.

    If recovery is successful, you will see a screen similar to below. If recovery is only partial, you can try to recover using the **Restore IDs and accounts option** in Wallet settings.

    .. Note::

        You cannot recover a wallet created in Mainnet in Testnet, and vice versa. Once you have recovered on the correct network, you can :ref:`switch between mainnet and testnet<switch-network>`.
        If you use both networks, you can recover on the other net after setup, through the settings page.

    .. Warning::

        If you had previously configured your wallet to be able to view selected tokens and you recover your wallet, the tokens will not be recovered. You must :ref:`add the tokens<tokens>` again to view them in your wallet.

    .. Note::

        If you forget your passcode for your installed |bw|, you will need to :ref:`remove the extension in your internet browswer and reinstall it<setup-browser-wallet>`, choosing the option to recover your wallet. Use your secret recovery phrase to recover the wallet.

.. dropdown:: |mw-gen2|

    #. After reinstalling the |mw-gen2| app, open the app.

    #. On the Getting Started screen, tap **Recover wallet**.

    #. After the screens explaining recovery tap **Continue**.

    #. Enter each word of your recovery phrase in the correct order. When you start typing, possible words appear for you to select. Once the words are correct, tap **Continue** to submit the recovery request to the identity provider(s).

        .. image:: ../images/mobile-wallet-gen2/recovery-enter-phrase.png

    #. When recovery is successful, the screen below appears.

    Sometimes recovery can take longer. You might encounter a partial recovery.

    This means that accounts and identities have been partially recovered. This could be because one of the identity providers is unresponsive. Tap **Try again** to attempt recovery again now or tap **Continue** to wait until later to try to recover. If you wait until later you can continue to the wallet.

    To continue recovery, tap |wallet-settings| and tap **Recovery** to continue.

    .. Note::

        When you recover your wallet, any account names that you might have edited will be reset to the account number. You can :ref:`edit the account name<change-mw-acct-name>`, if desired.

.. dropdown:: |mw-gen1|

    Recovery of |mw-gen1| requires a valid backup file. For more information about this process, see :ref:`backup and restore<mobile-wallet-recover>`.

.. dropdown:: Desktop Wallet

    The recovery process for Desktop Wallet is different because of the LEDGER device. For detailed instructions, see :ref:`Desktop Wallet backup and recovery<desktop-wallet-recover>`.
