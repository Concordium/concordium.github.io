Recover your Wallet
===================

In case you get a new device or need to restore your existing device, you can recover your identities, accounts, and keys with the secret recovery phrase you wrote down during wallet setup.

.. Note::

    You cannot recover testnet wallets on mainnet, or vice versa.

        #. Enter your 24 word secret recovery phrase. Click **Continue**.

        #. Select whether to recover your wallet in Mainnet or Testnet.

        .. Note::

            You cannot recover a wallet created in Mainnet in Testnet, and vice versa. Once you have recovered on the correct network, you can :ref:`switch between mainnet and testnet<switch-network>`.

.. Note::

    When you recover your wallet, any account names that you might have edited will be reset to the account number. You can edit the account name, if desired.
