Create a transaction report
===========================

A transaction report can be useful when you need to know transaction details, such as for tax reporting purposes.

    When you select an account, you can see a list of all transfers in and out of the account. However, if you need a more structured view of the transfers or, for example, want to compare transfers on different accounts, you have the option of creating an account report. The report is saved as a CSV file on your computer, and the CSV format enables you to sort and organize the data in a spreadsheet.

    You can make a report for one or more accounts.

    #. Go to **Accounts** and select the account you want to create a report for.

    #. Select **Change view**, and then select **Make account report**.

    #. Select the time period that you want the report to cover.

    #. Select the transaction types that you want to include in the report.

    #. If you want to include more accounts in the report, select **Add another account** in the right pane, and then select the relevant account. Repeat this step for each account you want to add to the report.

    #. Select **Make account report**. A CSV file with the selected account and types of transactions is generated and stored on your computer. If you have selected multiple accounts, you will get a .zip file containing a .CSV for each account.

    You can also use `CCDScan <https://ccdscan.io/>`__ to generate a CSV file of transactions for an account. For more information, see the :ref:`CCDScan account documentation<home-screen-sender>`.

    For all other wallets, use `CCDScan <https://ccdscan.io/>`__ to export a transaction log to a CSV file. For more information, see the :ref:`CCDScan account documentation<home-screen-sender>`.
