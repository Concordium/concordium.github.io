========================

You can add, inspect, and send tokens in the |bw|.

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: |bw|

        To access tokens and token transactions, tap Tokens (screenshot). Tabs appear for tokens.
    
        .. tabs::
        
            .. tab:: Add a token

                Tap **Add New**. (screenshot)

                Enter a smart contract address on which to look for tokens. Tap **Look for tokens**. If you get an error that says **Invalid contract address** this means that the smart contract doesn’t exist, the smart contract doesn’t live up to the CIS-2 standard, or the smart contract doesn’t contain any tokens. (screenshot)

                Select the token(s) you want to add. You can tap on a token to see more information about it and then tap **Back to list** to return to the list to select tokens. Tap **Add tokens** once you have made your selection. (screenshot)

                .. Note::

                    You can add NFTs that are not owned by your account to your wallet. This does not mean that you have ownership of the NFT.

                Once the tokens are added you can see them on the relevant tab.

            .. tab:: Inspect a token

                Tap the tab for the token you want to inspect. Then tap on the token to see details for that token. (screenshot)

            .. tab:: Send a token

                Tap Send |send-bw| in the Tokens overview.

                In the Search field tap to search for the token you want to send. (screenshot)

                In the amount field enter the amount of the token you want to send. The number of decimal places depends on the token.

                Add the receiver address. Paste the address, use the address book, or scan a QR code to add the address.

                .. note::
                    If the token is a CCD token, you have the option to add a memo to the transaction. Remember that memos increase the transaction fee.

                Tap **Send funds**.

                Review the transaction. When satisfied, tap **Send funds**.

                Tap **Finish**.
