   .. Note::
      Shielded transfers and Shielded balance is only available on accounts with a single credential. You can't make or receive shielded transfers on multi-signature accounts.

The Transactions box contains the 10 latest transactions on the account including transfers to other accounts, shielded transfers, and scheduled transfers.

If you have any log filters on the account they are also applied here.

- **Register as a delegator**: Register the account as a delegator. See :ref:`Delegation<delegation-concept>` for information about delegation. If you are already delegating, you'll see **Delegation** which contains a list of options for managing delegation.

Desktop Wallet settings
=======================

The Desktop Wallet has a number of settings such as password and node settings that you access by going to the **Settings** page.

Preferences
-----------

The Desktop Wallet provides a set of multi-signature transactions called Foundation transactions that only members of the Concordium Foundation can sign.

These transactions are disabled by default, and if you're not a member of the Concordium Foundation it is strongly recommended that you don't enable them. If you do enable the transactions, they will be listed on the multi-signature transactions page. However, you'll not be able to actually sign or submit any of these transactions.

Node settings
-------------

Here you specify which node on the blockchain that you want to connect to.

- If you're running the **mainnet** version of the Desktop Wallet, you must connect to a mainnet node. In the **Address field**, enter ``127.0.0.1`` and in the **Port field** enter ``10000``.

- If you're running the **testnet** version of the Desktop Wallet, you must connect to a testnet node. In the **Address** field, enter ``127.0.0.1`` and in the **Port field** enter ``10001``.

- Select **Set connection**. If the connection works, there's a message saying **Successfully connected**.

You can run a node using :ref:`Windows<run-node-windows>`, :ref:`macOS <run-node-macos>`, and :ref:`with Docker <run-a-node>` or :ref:`a Debian package <run-node-ubuntu>` on Linux.
