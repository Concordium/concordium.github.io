==================================================
Terms and Conditions for |bw|
==================================================

Effective from October XX, 2022

Introduction
============

|bw| is a digital wallet that is offered by Concordium Software ApS (‘Concordium Software’).
At `developer.concordium.software <https://developer.concordium.software>`_, you can read about how the wallet works. Concordium Software may continually change and/or adjust the functions of |bw|. Concordium Software’s terms and conditions apply to |bw| users.

The wallet will register and use data about you. Concordium Software will not register or use data about you.

Terms and conditions for all services and functions
===================================================

Parties to the agreement
------------------------

When you register with |bw|, you enter into an agreement with:

Concordium Software ApS, Amaliegade 4, 1256 København K, Denmark. CVR no.: 42334758. Our email address is contact@concordium.software.

What you need in order to register with |bw|
=================================================================

The following is required to register with |bw|:

- Have a computer with a supported browser version installed. You can see which browser versions can be used at `developer.concordium.software <https://developer.concordium.software>`_.
- Access to download and install browser extensions in your computer’s browser.
- Verify your identity with an identity provider. The identity provider will know your identity.

You must be at least 18 years old to register.

Registering as a |bw| user
===============================================

When you register in |bw|, you will generate private keys and you will receive a unique 24-word recovery phrase that must be stored in a safe place. The recovery phrase is the “master key” for all of your accounts – it is your private keys in mnemonic form. These words, when entered into another Concordium Wallet (not including the Cordordium Desktop Wallet) in the correct order, will recover all of the private keys you were storing on your original wallet. The recovery phrase is used as your personal backup of your private keys. If you lose the private keys and the recovery phrase, you will lose access to any funds in the account(s) permanently.

Before you can use |bw|, you will need to create a digital identity certificate by following the instructions in the app. An identity provider is a third-party supplier and independent of Concordium Software. The |bw| stores data in encrypted form from the identity provider, which Concordium Software does not have access to.

After you have created your digital identity certificate and your first account, you can create additional accounts with which you will be able to carry out transactions. Concordium Software may impose a limit to how many accounts you can create in a single |bw|.

Activation code and personal password
=====================================

When you register in |bw|, you will need to create a personal password. If your computer supports it, you can subsequently activate your fingerprint or use facial recognition instead of the password. You should be aware that all fingerprints/facial recognitions linked to your computer can be used to log on to |bw| and use the functions. You are therefore obliged to ensure that you have only activated your own fingerprints and your own facial recognition if you want to use them instead of the password for access to |bw|. |bw| does not store your fingerprints or facial recognition.

Other obligations etc.
======================

You have a duty to ensure that the details you provide are correct and updated at any given time. Your |bw| is personal and may only be used by you. You must not disclose your passwords to others, write them down, or save them on your mobile device or computer. You must not disclose your 24-word recovery phrase to others or store them digitally on your computer or mobile device.

|bw| must not be used for illegal activities or purposes.

You must not use |bw| in a way that harasses other Concordium blockchain users.

All transaction requests are irreversible. You are yourself responsible for ensuring that the recipient of a transaction via |bw| is the intended recipient, and you must verify that the transaction amount is correct. You are responsible for providing the correct account to persons and users who want to transfer funds to you.

To prevent unauthorized use of |bw|, you must store your computer so that others cannot gain unauthorized access to it. If possible, you should lock your computer with a password or keypad lock. Do not disclose the password to third parties.

You are obliged to verify your identity with an identity provider. The identity provider will know your identity, but will not be able to associate it to an account on the blockchain. Your identity can be revealed via the process of anonymity revocation, which can happen under stringent regulations, such as a court order.

You are solely responsible for safekeeping your passwords, PINs, account keys, encryption keys, identity, and any other codes you use to access the |bw| or any information, CCD, or voucher. If you lose access to the |bw|, private keys, or identity, and you have not separately stored a backup of your accounts and the corresponding password(s), or your personal recovery phrase, you acknowledge and agree that any tokens you have associated with that account will become inaccessible.

Please note: If you have chosen to use assistants based on speech recognition (e.g., Siri) or patterns of use, this means that information about your use of |bw|, including recipients, amounts, and messages, is sent to the provider of the assistant. Your own use of any assistant determines what information is sent. |bw| does not send any information.

Term
====

This agreement will apply between you and Concordium Software from your download of the |bw|, and until you have completely removed the |bw| in its entirety from your browser.

The section *Concordium Software’s liability for damages* shall apply indefinitely.

Fees and charges
================

Concordium Software currently does not charge any fee for registration with |bw|. |bw| does not charge a transaction fee; however, you have to pay a transaction fee for transactions on the blockchain.

Any other costs and charges related to your use of the |bw| shall be paid by you, including but not limited to costs to the identity provider, if any.

If we introduce new functions, features, products, or services, these may be subject to fees from the start without you receiving any notice of changed terms and conditions. You will always be informed about the fee before you register for the function, feature, product, or service.

Changes
=======

You will be notified on `developer.concordium.software <https://developer.concordium.software>`_ if we change the terms and conditions. We may change the terms and conditions without notice. You can read the terms and
conditions at `developer.concordium.software <https://developer.concordium.software>`_, from which you can also print, download, or email them.

If you do not wish to be covered by the new terms and conditions, you must notify us before the new terms and conditions enter into force. If you notify us that you do not wish to be covered by the new terms and conditions, we will consider the |bw| agreement to be terminated from the date on which the new terms and conditions enter into force. If we do not hear from you, we will regard it as your acceptance of the changes.

Concordium Software retains all right, title, and interest in and to all of Concordium Software’s brands, logos, and trademarks, including, but not limited to, |bw|, Concordium Desktop Wallet, Concordium Mobile Wallet, |mw-gen1|, |mw-gen2|, Concordium Client, and variations of the wording of the said brands, logos, and trademarks.

Concordium Software’s liability for damages
===========================================

Concordium Software is not liable for damages for late or defective performance of the |bw| and/or our contractual obligations resulting from error or negligence.

Even in areas in which stricter liability applies, Concordium Software is not liable for losses arising from

-  Breakdown of or lack of access to IT systems or damage to data in these systems attributable to any of the events listed below regardless of whether Concordium Software or a third-party supplier is responsible for the operation of these systems, power failure, or breakdown of Concordium Software’s power supply system or telecommunications,    statutory intervention or administrative acts, acts of God, war, revolution, riot, civil unrest, sabotage, terrorism, or vandalism (including computer virus attacks or hacking).

-  Strikes, lockouts, boycotts, or picketing, regardless of whether Concordium Software or its organization is itself a party to or has started such an industrial dispute and regardless of its cause. This also applies if the dispute affects only parts of Concordium Software.

-  Other circumstances beyond or within the control of Concordium Software.

Please be advised that Concordium Software is not liable for any defects or deficiencies in the goods or services for which you pay using |bw|. Concordium Software accepts no liability for the fundraising campaigns to which you make contributions using |bw|. If you have any complaints regarding the delivered goods, services, or fundraising campaigns, you must contact the seller and/or the fundraiser.

Concordium Software does not undertake any liability for the conduct of the seller/fundraiser in general.

Privacy
=======

Concordium Software respects your privacy to the effect that Concordium Software will not monitor, edit, or disclose any personal information about you or your account, including its contents or your use of the |bw|, without your prior consent unless Concordium Software in good faith beliefs that such action is necessary to: (i) comply with legal process or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Concordium Software; (iii) enforce this Agreement; (iv) protect the interests of users of the |bw| other than you or any other person; (v) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of Concordium’s services or equipment, including the |bw| as authorized by law; or (vi) if your identity is revoked in accordance with the identity revocation process as required to comply with (i). You are assumed to have no expectation of privacy with respect to the Internet generally. Your IP address is transmitted and recorded with each message or other information you send from the |bw|. When you create an identity with a third party supplier, you have entered an agreement directly with such a third party supplier and such a third party supplier will store data about you and in this case, the third party supplier’s privacy policy and terms and conditions apply.

Data retention and deletion
===========================

Concordium as a company does not retain and therefore cannot delete any user identifiable information. However, to get an account you must obtain an identity object issued by an identity provider. The identity object contains some user identifiable information such as your name. By default the identity object is only stored encrypted in the wallet and is not visible on the chain. Some data derived from the identity object is sent to the chain, but by default it is not possible to obtain user identifiable information from the information stored in the account on the chain. However, if you choose to reveal any attributes associated with your account, these attributes will be visible on-chain, and can never be deleted.

Governing law and venue
=======================

The agreement and any dispute arising out of the agreement are governed by Danish law and such disputes must be heard by Copenhagen District Court or the jurisdiction of the defendant’s domicile unless otherwise provided by absolute consumer rights in Denmark. This applies without consideration for rules in international private law which may lead to the application of other law than Danish law.

Complaints
==========

You can always write to Concordium Software if you disagree with us. In this way, we make sure that such disagreement is not based on a misunderstanding. The address is Amaliegade 4, 1256 København K, Denmark.

New copy of these terms and conditions

You can always find the latest version on `developer.concordium.software <https://developer.concordium.software>`_.
