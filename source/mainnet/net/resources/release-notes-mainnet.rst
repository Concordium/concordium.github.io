|bw| 0.9.8
---------------------------

The following issues are fixed in |bw| 0.9.8:

 - Corrected an issue where incorrect CIS-2 token metadata URL serialization for tokens with checksums caused those to be unable to be added.
 - Init contract transaction now displays as "Contract initialization".
 - Update contract transaction now displays as "Contract update".
 - addCIS2Tokens now returns the list of added tokens without an internal wrapper.

February 27, 2023

|mw-gen2| 1.1.5
---------------

A potential security risk was discovered with the storage of the secret recovery phrase on Android phones. The patch changes the way that the secret recovery phrase is stored in the Android app, and it’s applied automatically once you login to the updated version (1.1.5) on your Android phone. Your secret recovery phrase does not change. We recommend all Android users to update their Concordium Wallet app to the latest version right away. The Concordium Wallet for iOS, desktop, and browser extensions are not affected by this issue.

February 6, 2023

|mw-gen1| for Android 3.2.0
---------------------------

Changed the text in the "Suggest update" alert to suggest that the user update to the |mw-gen2| so it matches the download button.

January 30, 2023

Cargo concordium 2.7.0
----------------------

Added base64 commands for schemas in ``cargo concordium``. These allow the schema to be
output in the base64 format that is currently supported in the |bw|.

January 26, 2023

|mw-gen2| 1.1.4
-----------------------

- Fix incorrect display of transactions proposed by dApps using WalletConnect.

- Fix incorrect NRG calculation performed by the wallet, which could lead to failed transactions.

January 19, 2023

Concordium Node 5.1.3
---------------------

Concordium node version 5.1.3 introduces the following new features and improvements:

- Improvements were made to allow greater concurrency with transaction processing.

- Blocks are relayed earlier. This decreases the time it takes for the network to become aware of a block.

- Removed the configuration option ``no_rebroadcast_consensus_validation``. This option (which was used for testing only and was disabled by default) made the node rebroadcast blocks before doing any validation.

- Changes were made to avoid deadlocks during node shutdown in specific scenarios.

- The node will now shut down to start if an error occurs in a required service (e.g., grpc server). In particular, the node will shut down if a required service could not be started.

- Added timeout to downloading out of band catchup files when block indices and catch-up chunk files are specified by an URL. The timeout is controlled by the option ``--download-blocks-timeout`` (environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_DOWNLOAD_BLOCKS_TIMEOUT``) and defaults to 5 minutes. Timeout is now five minutes per chunk instead of waiting indefinitely.

- Removed the ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_PROMETHEUS_SERVER`` environment variable. The prometheus server is now started if ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_PROMETHEUS_LISTEN_PORT`` is set.

Cargo concordium 2.6.0
----------------------

Added the ability to output the schema in JSON format which can be more suitable for use in dApps.

January 9, 2023

|bw| 0.9.6
---------------------------

SendTransaction for smart contract transactions can receive schemas that are for the specific parameter.

January 4, 2023

Concordium Node 5.0.7 for MacOS
-------------------------------

Fix a bug in the MacOS node that caused an issue with NRG calculation. Concordium recommends that MacOS node runners update their nodes to 5.0.7.

Mainnet 4: Sirius
=================

.. Note::

   Prior to Sirius, the nodes enforced that a transaction could not be deployed until 2 hours before its expiry date. With Sirius, node validation of transactions has been improved and the 2 hour window has been removed.

December 21, 2022

|bw| 0.9.5
----------------------

Minor bugfixes for the |bw|, including adding a missing background color on ID proof cards, fixing an issue where the transaction list did not update automatically, and a minor adjustment to how proof of age is calculated.

December 16, 2022

|bw| 0.9.4
----------------------

The |bw| introduces ID2.0 functionality whereby a dApp or service can use zero knowledge proofs to request proof from a wallet for certain attributes without revealing anything beyond the truth of the statement. It is also possible for a dApp or Service to request that the wallet user reveal attributes.

December 14, 2022

Cargo concordium 2.5.0
----------------------

- Add support for sampling random numbers for randomized testing with `cargo concordium test`.
- Add support for providing a seed to initialize a random generator to `cargo-concordium`. The generator can be used for randomized testing.
  Command format: `cargo concordium test --seed 1234567890`. The provided seed value is a `u64` number. If the seed is not provided, a random one will be sampled.

Concordium Client 5.0.2
-----------------------

Receive function parameters are now displayed as JSON in transaction status whenever they could be succesfully parsed by a smart contract schema embedded in the module or supplied by the user using the ``--schema`` option.

Smart contract libraries
------------------------

Smart contract libraries have also been updated.

December 13, 2022

`Protocol version 5 <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals/blob/main/updates/P5.txt>`_ is effective from today at 08:05 UTC. One important change because of the protocol update is that in the future (from 14 December 2022) pay day for rewards shifts to 08:05 UTC instead of 08:00 UTC.

December 8, 2022

|mw-gen2| 1.1.0
-----------------------

The |mw-gen2| introduces functionality to connect to dApps and services using WalletConnect. This functionality is currently in beta mode.

December 6, 2022

|bw| 0.8.5
--------------------

The |bw| now includes support to manage fungible and non-fungible tokens. This includes adding, inspecting, and removing tokens.

November 29, 2022

Concordium Node 5.0.6
---------------------

Concordium Node 5.0.6 contains support for `protocol version 5 <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals/blob/main/updates/P5.txt>`_ which will be released on Mainnet on December 13, 2022. This adds the following features:

   - Support for smart contract upgradability
   - Query the current exchange rates, account balances, and contract balances from a smart contract.
   - Relax restrictions on smart contracts, including:
      - Parameter size limit: 1kiB -> 65535B
      - Return value size limit: 16kiB -> no limit (apart from energy)
      - Number of logs per invocation: 64 -> no limit (apart from energy)
   - A new representation of accounts that is better optimised for common operations.
   - Revised the hashing scheme for transaction outcomes in protocol version 5. In particular, the exact reject reasons are no longer part of the computed hash. Furthermore, the transaction outcomes are being stored in a merkle tree for P5, resulting in faster speed for some queries.

Additionally, the node update fixes an issue where the catch-up downloader would fail at a protocol update.

November 21, 2022

Cargo concordium 2.4.0
----------------------

Cargo concordium 2.4.0 contains support for the upcoming `protocol version 5 <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals/blob/main/updates/P5.txt>`_ which is planned for release on Testnet November 22, 2022. This includes the following new features:

- Build and test contracts using new protocol 5 features, such as upgradability and chain queries.
- Support for relaxed smart contract resource restrictions in ``cargo concordium run``.
- ``cargo concordium build`` now checks contracts with respect to protocol version 5 semantics.

Concordium Client 5.0.1
-----------------------

Concordium Client 5.0.1 adds support for the upcoming `protocol version 5 <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-update-proposals/blob/main/updates/P5.txt>`_ which is planned for release on Testnet November 22, 2022.
It also adds a ``--secure`` flag to enable connecting to gRPC using TLS. All commands that query the node support this.

Additionally, it supports contract schema V3. V3 schemas offer the same options as V2, but also optionally includes a schema for contract events. `transaction status` now displays contract events, and a schema can be provided with `--schema`, which will be used to parse the contract events. By default events are parsed with the schema embedded in the contract, if present. This enables ``concordium-client`` to interact with contracts and schemas using `concordium-std` version 5. There is also improved formatting of `transaction status` output using contract schemas if they are available for displaying contract events, and output function parameters are shown as hex strings in `transaction status`.

November 17, 2022

|mw-gen1| for Android
---------------------

Identity and account creation has been locked in |mw-gen1| for Android devices. This means that you cannot create new identities or accounts in |mw-gen1| on an Android device. You can continue to use |mw-gen1|, but if you need to create a new identity or account you must use |mw-gen2|. You can also still recover your wallet from a backup file in |mw-gen1| on an Android device.

October 25, 2022

Concordium Node 4.5.0
---------------------

Concordium Node 4.5.0 contains the :ref:`updated gRPC API <grpc2-documentation>`
which is easier to use than the previous version. It also contains bug fixes and
performance and robustness improvements.

- Node gRPC API v2 is released and enabled in all distributions.
- The node is now able to recover after crashes which leave only treestate or only blockstate usable.
- Fix a memory leak that could occur in certain usage scenarios involving smart contracts.

October 19, 2022

|bw|
---------------------

The |bw| extension for Chrome web browsers is released. It provides basic wallet functionality, such as sending and receiving CCDs. It also has the possibility to connect dApps to a wallet to interact with the Concordium blockchain.

October 12, 2022

Cargo concordium 2.2.0
----------------------

Cargo concordium 2.2.0 introduces the ``init`` subcommand that can initialize a new project and use contract templates to set up an initial project.

October 5, 2022

Concordium Node 4.4.4
---------------------

Concordium Node 4.4.4 contains performance improvements and bug fixes.

- Smart contract state is no longer cached on startup and is not cached after
  finalization. This reduces the node's memory use and startup time.

- Smart contract modules are no longer retained in memory. Module artifacts are loaded as needed
  during contract execution. Metadata is cached for a limited number of smart contract modules.
  By default, the cache will retain metadata for at most 1000 smart contract modules, and this is
  configurable via the ``--modules-cache-size`` command line argument or by using the
  ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_MODULES_CACHE_SIZE`` environment variable.

- Speed up and reduce memory overhead during protocol updates. Overhead in
  memory use during protocol updates should now be less than 20%, and time to
  process a protocol update should be around 1/3 of the previous release.

- The node now validates blocks more eagerly and does not relay blocks it cannot
  fit into the tree, i.e., pending blocks.

- The ``--download-blocks-from`` option now takes the URL to the catchup ``_index file_``, permitting to
  only download and import catchup files containing blocks not already present in the database.

- Partial node database recovery. The node is now able to recover from the most
  common causes of its database corruption.

- Fix typo in environment variable ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_PROMETHEUS_LISTEN_ADDRESSS`` (remove trailing `S`).

- Fix a bug in Ctrl-C signal handling where a node would fail to stop if
  interrupted early on in the startup if out-of-band catchup was enabled.

Concordium Client 4.2.0
-----------------------

- Fix handling of ``--no-confirm`` in ``contract init``, ``contract update``, ``module deploy``, and ``register data`` transactions. This flag is now respected.
- Add support for import of keys from |bw|.
- Fix some inconsistencies in the display format of CCD amounts.

September 26, 2022

|mw-gen2|
---------

Concordium introduces a new wallet for Android mobile devices: the |mw-gen2|. The |mw-gen2| offers all of the same functionality you know from |mw-gen1|, such as sending and receiving CCDs, delegation, baking, and so on. But the |mw-gen2| uses a secret recovery phrase to generate your private keys, simplifying any restoration of an account should you lose access to the phone/app. This version also supports easy portability of accounts between this and the soon to be released |bw|. You can read about |mw-gen2| and the differences between it and |mw-gen1| in the :ref:`FAQ<mw-gen2-faq>`.

In connection with this new wallet, the Android mobile wallet previously known as Concordium Mobile Wallet has been renamed |mw-gen1|.

|mw-gen1| (previously Concordium Mobile Wallet) for Android
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Concordium Mobile Wallet has been renamed to |mw-gen1| with the release of the |mw-gen2|. If you are creating your first identity, Concordium recommends downloading and using |mw-gen2|.

September 5, 2022

Concordium Node 4.3.1
---------------------

Concordium Node 4.3.1 introduces a number of performance improvements. The effects of these are that the node on mainnet at the current load will use around 1/4 the memory of the `4.2.3` node. Startup can be up to 50% faster, although exact improvements will be platform dependent.

- Account records are no longer constantly retained in memory. Instead, a limited number are retained in a cache. The number of cached accounts defaults to 10000 and can be configured by the ``--accounts-cache-size`` command line argument or the ``CONCORDIUM_NODE_CONSENSUS_ACCOUNTS_CACHE_SIZE`` environment variable.
- Reduce startup time and memory use further by reducing the amount of block data retained in memory. In particular finalized blocks are no longer stored in memory.
- Optimize node data structures related to accounts. This reduces node memory use and improves performance.
- The gRPC API now reports correctly when the sender of a transaction did not have enough funds to cover the transaction costs.
- Remove obsolete and unused option ``--max-expiry-duration``.
- Remove transaction logging functionality from the node. It is replaced by an external `transaction logger <https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-transaction-logger>`_ service. As a consequence the ``transaction-outcome-logging`` family of command line options are removed from the node.

August 24, 20222

Concordium Client 4.1.0
-----------------------

- Fix bug in contract schema parsing caused by endiannes confusion.
- Add support for smart contract schema V2. V2 schemas offer the same options as V1, but can also include a schema for the error type. This enables `concordium-client` to interact with contracts built using `concordium-std` version 4.

Cargo concordium 2.1.0
----------------------

Use schemas for error values when simulating contracts. In particular support building and testing contracts with `concordium-std` version 4.

August 4, 2022

Concordium Client 4.0.4
-----------------------

The `concordium-client` has been updated to better support the new smart contract v1 schema.

Cargo concordium 2.0.2
----------------------

Cargo concordium has also been updated to better support the new smart contract v1 schema.

Concordium Node 4.2.3 for Docker
--------------------------------

Some improvements have been made to the Docker node version. The new Docker images (one for Mainnet and one for Testnet) are designed for use with docker-compose or a similar driver. The node also requires a database which must be stored on the host system so that it persists when the Docker container is stopped.

It is not mandatory but **strongly recommended** for Linux node runners to migrate to the new Docker distribution. The old Docker images will be deprecated and future node versions from 4.3 and upwards will only be provided in the new distribution.

Concordium Desktop Wallet 1.5.0
-------------------------------

The Concordium Desktop Wallet now supports the Ledger Nano S Plus hardware wallet.

Fixed an issue on macOS that prevented automatic updates from installing after successfully being downloaded and verified. **This means that macOS users have to download this release manually.**

August 2, 2022

Concordium Node 4.2.3
---------------------

Concordium Node 4.2.3 fixes a critical security vulnerability present in all
previous 4.* node versions. All node runners **must** upgrade as soon as
possible.

The security advisory detailing the issue and the patch will be released on
August 15th.

July 4, 2022

Concordium Node 4.2.1
----------------------

Concordium Node 4.2.1 is a maintenance release, bringing performance improvements and bugfixes. The highlights are:

- A significant decrease in node startup time. The exact improvements are platform dependent, but startup should be at least 6 times faster on mainnet.
- A significant decrease in node memory use. On mainnet, a 4.2.1 node should use less than 50% of memory compared to 4.1.1.
- Reduced CPU use of passive nodes in Windows, Mac, and Linux distributions.

June 30, 2022

Concordium Mobile Wallet for iOS v3.0.0(53)
------------------------------------------------

Concordium Mobile Wallet for iOS 3.0.0 contains the long-awaited and highly anticipated delegation and baking functionality.

You can now delegate stake to a baker pool or passive delegation from Mobile Wallet, update delegation, or stop delegation.

If you have enough stake to become a baker, you can also do that from Mobile Wallet. Additionally, you can open a baker pool, update baker stake and settings, update your baker keys, or stop baking.

June 27, 2022

Concordium Mobile Wallet for Android v3.0.0(100)
------------------------------------------------

Concordium Mobile Wallet 3.0.0 contains the long-awaited and highly anticipated delegation and baking functionality.

You can now delegate stake to a baker pool or passive delegation from Mobile Wallet, update delegation, or stop delegation.

If you have enough stake to become a baker, you can also do that from Mobile Wallet. Additionally, you can open a baker pool, update baker stake and settings, update your baker keys, or stop baking.

This functionality will be available for iOS shortly.

June 21, 2022

Concordium Desktop Wallet v1.4.2
--------------------------------
Concordium Desktop Wallet 1.4.2 is a hotfix release specifically for macOS containing the following fixes:

-   Fixed an issue on macOS where an error popup would show after closing the main application window and opening it again.
-   Fixed an issue on macOS where identity creation was not possible after closing the main application window and opening it again.

June 15, 2022

Concordium Node 4.1.1
---------------------

Concordium Node 4.1.1 introduces new functionality to support delegation to baker pools or passive delegation, and a new version Smart Contracts.

Note that when the protocol update happens on June 23, 2022 that the cool-down period for reducing baker stake or stopping baking increases from one week to three weeks. If you reduce your stake or stop baking BEFORE the protocol update takes effect, the cool-down remains one week.

V1 smart contracts include the following key features:
   - Unlimited contract state size
   - Synchronous contract calls
   - Fallback entrypoints
   - An increased smart contract module size limit of 512kB
   - A number of cryptographic primitives

Other improvements in this version include:
   - The SendTransaction function exposed via the gRPC interface now provides the caller with detailed error messages.
   - Support for wire-protocol version 0 is dropped, meaning that the node cannot connect to peers that do not support wire-protocol version 1, which is supported since version 1.1.0.
   - The macOS installer has been improved so it no longer overwrites the service files when reinstalling.
   - When using the Mac installer users now can leave one (but not both) of the net configurations empty when they don't want to configure a node for it. On the initial installation, leaving a net configuration empty means that the start/stop app shortcuts and the application support folder for that net won't be installed.
   - Consensus queries have been made more robust by validating input more extensively. This affects all queries whose input was a block or transaction hash. These queries now return an InvalidArgument error.
   - The maximum number of retries for Node Collector has been removed so it will keep querying indefinitely.
   - Nodes can now be stopped during out of band catchup by using the signals ``SIGINT`` and ``SIGTERM``.
   - The ``GetAccountInfo`` endpoint supports querying the account via the account index.
   - Baker pools and stake delegation are implemented for the P4 protocol version.
   - The new gRPC endpoint ``GetBakerList`` retrieves a JSON list of the baker IDs of the bakers registered in a known block. It returns null for an unknown block.
   - The new gRPC endpoint ``GetPoolStatus`` retrieves a status record for a baker pool, or for the set of passive delegators.
   - The bakerStakeThreshold level-2 keys are renamed to poolParameters keys; two additional access structures are defined: cooldownParameters and timeParameters.
   - Smart contract modules are cached on startup from the existing state to improve smart contract execution.

Concordium Client 4.0.3
-----------------------

Concordium Client 4.0.3 supports version 1 Smart Contracts with the following changes.

   - A ``contract invoke`` command has been added for simulating contracts locally on the node.
   - Module deploy now expects modules with a version prefix. This prefix is added automatically when building with cargo-concordium version >= 2. The flag ``--contract-version`` has been added to support modules without the version prefix.
   - The ``contract update`` command now uses ``--entrypoint`` to specify the function to invoke. This is renamed from the previous ``--func``.
   - When calling ``contract update`` or ``contract invoke`` with a non-existent entrypoint the fallback entrypoint is called if one is specified in the contract.

Concordium Client 4.0.3 also supports delegation to baker pools or passive delegation, and commands have been added to open baker pools.

   - The commands ``delegator add``, ``delegator configure`` and ``delegator remove`` have been added. Commands to support the baker opening a baker pool have also been added, including ``baker configure``, ``baker update-url`` and ``baker update-delegation-status``.
   - The existing commands ``baker add``, ``baker remove``, ``baker set-key``, ``baker update-restake`` and ``baker update-stake`` have been updated so that in Protocol version < 4, they generate the former P3 transaction, and in Protocol version 4, they generate the relevant ``configure baker`` transaction.
   - Support has been added for the raw queries ``GetPoolStatus`` and ``GetBakerList``.
   - The subcommand ``consensus show-chain-parameters`` has been added to show the chain parameters. This subcommand shows useful information, such as the amount needed to become a baker, bounding caps for baker pools, commission percentages for delegation, exchange rate parameters, and more.

Concordium Desktop Wallet v1.4.1
--------------------------------

Concordium Desktop Wallet 1.4.1 contains functionality to support delegation to baker pools or passive delegation. In addition, the Desktop Wallet has an improved user interface. Note that the delegation functionality will not work until the protocol update occurs on June 23, 2022.

The Concordium Ledger app 3.0.1 is also released. With the Sirius release, Ledger firmware version 2.0.0 is no longer supported.

In addition, the following changes were made:

- When choosing a delegation target a link is now available that forwards the user to the delegation documentation website.
- Fixed an issue that made it impossible to create a transaction to do passive delegation.
- Fixed an issue that caused the wallet to crash when inspecting identities with missing date attributes.

Mainnet 1: Alpha Centauri 1.0
=============================

June 9, 2021

We are proud to announce that version 1 of the Concordium blockchain infrastructure, the “Alpha Centauri” release, is available for download.

Our Mainnet release has the following main features:

Proof of Stake
--------------

The Concordium Blockchain uses a proof of stake mechanism to ensure resource-efficient operation of the network.

Two Layer Consensus Protocol
----------------------------

-  Nakamoto-Style Consensus
   Bakers participate in a form of lottery to win the right to append blocks to the chain.

-  Finality Layer
   Concordium finality layer dynamically ‘checkpoints’ the blockchain using Byzantine agreement to identify and mark common blocks in the chains of honest users as final.

Built in IDLayer
----------------

Account creation is based on a validated identity, but at the same time it provides transactional privacy for users with a mechanism that allows accountability to local regulatory authorities.

Transactional privacy is further enhanced by support for shielded transfers.

Smart Contracts
---------------

Concordium blockchain has native support for smart contracts on-chain with our core on-chain language WebAssembly (Wasm), a portable well-defined assembly-like language.

Rust is the first off-chain high level smart contract language.

Tokenomics and On-chain Incentivization
---------------------------------------

The Concordium blockchain comprises a set of transactions and economic roles that interact within the economy. An economic role, such as a baker or account holder, is represented by an account on the Concordium platform.

The flow of CCD between accounts via transactions creates an economy that is designed to incentivize participation in the network and counter dishonest behaviour. It is the objective of the Concordium Foundation to guide the creation of a sustainable economy that rewards participants for their efforts in developing the network.

Concordium Node
---------------
The Concordium node software is available for Linux and available in two different packages:

-  A distribution package, which provides wrappers for setting up the node in a Docker image.

-  A Debian package built for Ubuntu 20.04. This package allows for greater customization of the node set up.

Mobile Wallet
-------------

The Mobile Wallet is available for iOS and Android with support for:

-  identity issuance and management.
-  account creation and management.
-  simple and shielded transactions.
-  platform security protection
-  export and import to other mobile wallets.
-  access to the blockchain through a “wallet proxy” operated by Concordium with no need to run a node.

Desktop Wallet
--------------

The Desktop Wallet is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux with support for:

-  identity issuance and management.
-  account creation and management.
-  protection by Ledger Nano S device.
-  multi signature account set up and management.
-  multiple transaction types:
   -  Simple
   -  Scheduled
   -  Shielded
   -  Multi-signature
-  filtering and printing historic transactions
-  baker management
-  access to blockchain via a service node, which is usually owned by the user of the Desktop Wallet.

Source Code
-----------

The source code for the Concordium Blockchain is free open source software. You can access our repositories on the `Concordium GitHub organization page <https://github.com/Concordium>`_.
