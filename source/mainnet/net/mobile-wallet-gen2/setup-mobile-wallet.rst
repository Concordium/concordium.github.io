Recovery passphrase
===================

Now you must write down and confirm your secret recovery passphrase. It is important to keep this passphrase in a safe location in case you need to recover your wallet on a new device.

#. Tap **Set up a fresh wallet**.

#. Tap on the screen to view your secret passphrase. Write down all 24 words in the exact order in which they are shown.

#. Place a check in the box **I confirm I have written down my 24 word secret recovery phrase**.

#. On the next screens select the word to enter in each index to confirm your secret recovery phrase. Once correct, tap **Continue**.

Request your identity and account
=================================

Having set up your passcode, possibly biometrics, and your secret passphrase, you must then submit a request for an identity
and an account. You do this immediately after setting up the passcode and biometrics.

Request identity
----------------

#. Read the next page in the app, shortly explaining the Concordium concepts of initial account and identity. Tap **Continue**.

#. Select a third party identity provider from the list. Enter your wallet passcode when prompted. An external web page opens within the app.

#. Enter the information requested by the third-party identity provider. The information might vary depending on the identity provider.
   However, they will ask you to provide photos of identification documents and a selfie.

#. When you have submitted the information to the identity provider, you will have a pending initial account and identity in your app.
   The verification or rejection is usually retrieved from the identity provider within minutes, but check your app frequently to retrieve
   the result. The result can be retrieved for up to seven days.

If your identity request is rejected, you see a message. Tap **Make new identity request** to create a new identity request. You can choose another identity provider.

Request account
---------------

Once the identity provider has verified your identity you can submit an account. You can see when your identity has been verified by the green check next to the identity name.

#. Tap **Submit account**. Enter your wallet passcode when prompted.

.. Note::
   To access the **Balance** of the new account, tap the Balance area on the account card or tap |morepage|.
