.. _ledger-app-download:

Concordium LEDGER App
=====================

Install the LEDGER App for use with the Desktop Wallet from LEDGER Live. For information, see :ref:`Install the LEDGER app<install-ledger>`.

.. _concordium-node-and-client-download:

Concordium Client |client-version|
===================================

-  `Download the Mainnet Concordium Client for Linux <https://distribution.concordium.software/tools/linux/concordium-client_6.0.1-0>`_

      - SHA256 checksum of the download: :substitution-code:`|client-linux-checksum|`
      - :ref:`Verification instructions <verification-client-linux>`

   Before you can use the downloaded Concordium Client on Linux you have to make the downloaded file executable. Run the following command to make the file you download executable:

      .. code-block:: console

         chmod +x concordium-client_*

   where you replace `*` with |client-version|.

-  `Download the Mainnet Concordium Client for macOS <https://distribution.concordium.software/tools/macos/signed/concordium-client-6.0.1.pkg>`_

   - The macOS distribution is an installer that places an alias to the binary
     into the folder ``/usr/local/bin``. So after installing, you should have
     ``concordium-client`` on your path.

-  `Download the Mainnet Concordium Client for Windows <https://distribution.concordium.software/tools/windows/signed/concordium-client_6.0.1-0.exe>`_

.. _cargo-concordium-testnet:

``cargo-concordium``
====================

For information about installing ``cargo-concordium``, see :ref:`Install tools for development <setup-tools>`.

.. Note::

   From version 2.8.0 the distribution for ``cargo-concordium`` has been simplified. Now, once you have installed rustup, you can quickly and easily install ``cargo-concordium`` without downloading a separate package or going through many steps. If you already have ``cargo-concordium`` installed, you may need to remove the existing ``cargo-concordium`` from your PATH to be able to update versions in the future.

VSCode extension
----------------

You can `install the VSCode extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Concordium.concordium-smart-contracts>`__ for smart contract development from the VSCode marketplace.

Smart contract deploy and initialize tool
=========================================

To ease deployment and initialization, you can use the `Smart contract deploy and initialize tool <https://sctools.mainnet.concordium.software/>`__. It works with the |bw| to deploy and initialize smart contracts to Mainnet and Testnet.
