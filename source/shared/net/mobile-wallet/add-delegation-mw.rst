=============================================
Add delegation to an account in Mobile Wallet
=============================================

.. Note::
    
    Currently delegation is only available on Testnet.

You can delegate some of your stake to a :ref:`baker pool<glossary-baker-pool>` or to  :ref:`passive delegation<glossary-passive-delegation>`. Before delegating stake to a baker pool, it is important to :ref:`research the pool<baker-pool>`. You can only have one delegation per account. If you wish to delegate CCD to multiple open pools, you can have multiple accounts and transfer CCD to those accounts to delegate.

.. Note::

   All transfers and transactions cost a fee, including delegation transactions. The fee is based on the set NRG for that transaction and the current exchange rate.
   The cost of transaction fees is stable in Euros, and therefore the price in CCD varies depending on the CCD to EUR exchange rate. The fee will always be deducted from the **Balance** of the account, so it is important to have some available CCDs to cover fees.
   You can see the fee in the transaction log.

#. Go to the **Accounts** screen.

#. Tap on the balance area of the account you want to delegate from or tap **More** (button picture).

#. Tap the hamburger menu (screenshot) and tap **Delegation**. If you are delegating for the first time, you see some information about delegation. Tap **Register delegation**.

#. If you want to delegate to a specific pool tap **Baker pool** and enter the Baker ID of the pool owner. If you are delegating to passive delegation, tap **Passive delegation**. Tap **Continue**.

#. You can see your balance available to delegate. **Enter the Amount you want to delegate** in the field. And tap **Yes, restake** to restake any rewards or tap **No, don't restake** if you donâ€™t want to restake rewards. If you do not restake, rewards are deposited to your disposable balance. Tap **Continue**.

#. Review the information in the transaction overview. When you are satisfied, tap **Submit delegation transaction**.

#. Once the transaction is submitted you see a confirmation screen. Tap **Finish** to complete the action.

Once the transaction is finalized, the delegation is effective from the next pay day.
