Create a new account with an existing identity
==============================================

When you created your identity, it came with an initial account. The initial account is a special account which is submitted
to the chain by the identity provider. When you already have an identity, you can submit more accounts to the chain with that identity yourself.

Create a new identity and initial account
=========================================

#. Go to the **Accounts** page.

#. Press the **+** in the upper right corner.

#. Enter a name for your new account. Press **Next**.

#. Choose which identity you want to use to create the account.

#. You now have the option to reveal some attributes publicly on the account. Unless you have a good reason to do so, we recommend not revealing any.

   - If you want to reveal some attributes press **Reveal account attributes**, select the attributes you want to reveal and then press **Submit account**.

#. If you donâ€™t want to reveal any attributes just press **Submit account**.

#. Finally, press **Ok, thanks**.

Your new account will now be visible on the Accounts page. It might take a little while for it to finalise on the chain, but it will soon be usable, if not already.
