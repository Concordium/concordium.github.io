When you created your :ref:`identity<glossary-identity>`, it came with an :ref:`initial accounts<glossary-initial-account>`. The initial account is a special account that the :ref:`identity provider<glossary-identity-provider>` submits
to the chain. When you already have an identity, you can submit more :ref:`accounts<glossary-account>` to the chain with that identity yourself.

To learn more about identities and accounts, see :ref:`<reference-id-accounts>` and :ref:`<managing_accounts>`.

Read the following or watch the video to learn how to create a new account.

#. Go to the **Accounts** page.

#. Tap the **+** in the upper right corner.

#. Enter a name for your new account. Tap **Next**.

#. If you donâ€™t want to reveal any attributes, tap **Submit account**.

#. Finally, tap **Ok, thanks**.

Your new account is now visible on the Accounts page. It might take a little while for it to finalize on the chain.
