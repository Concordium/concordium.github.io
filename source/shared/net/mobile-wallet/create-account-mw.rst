When you created your :ref:`identity<glossary-identity>`, it came with an :ref:`initial accounts<glossary-initial-account>`. The initial account is a special account that the :ref:`identity provider<glossary-identity-provider>` submits
to the chain. When you already have an identity, you can submit more :ref:`accounts<glossary-account>` to the chain with that identity yourself.

To learn more about identities and accounts, see :ref:`Identities <reference-id-accounts>` and :ref:`Accounts <managing_accounts>`.

Read the following or watch the video to learn how to create a new account.

Your new account is now visible on the Accounts page. It might take a little while for it to finalize on the chain.

.. Warning::
   **Backup is essential. If you lose your mobile phone or need to restore your mobile phone and you don't have a backup from the Mobile Wallet, you can't access your wallet and your CCDs are permanently inaccessible.**
   **Concordium does not take any responsibility if you lose access to your accounts. Concordium strongly advise you to complete a backup every time you create an account and store the backup file in a secure place - preferably offline.**
   For more information, see :ref:`Make a backup of identities and accounts in Mobile Wallet<export-import-mw>`.

.. Note::
   To access the **Balance** of the new account, tap the Balance area on the account card or tap |moredetails|.
