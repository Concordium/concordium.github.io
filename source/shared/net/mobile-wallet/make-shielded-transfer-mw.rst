This topic describes how to make a shielded GTU transaction from an account in the Mobile Wallet. If you are looking
for a guide on  how to make a regular GTU transfer, you can find the guide :ref:`here <make-simple-transfer-mw>`.

.. Note::
   A shielded transfer is a transfer between two accounts, where the **amount** of the transfer is encrypted. Sender, receiver and the potential memo will be publicly visible on the blockchain.

Make a shielded GTU transfer from an account
============================================

#. Go to the Accounts page.

#. Select the Account you want to transfer GTU from, and press the **Shielded balance** area of the account card.

#. Press **SEND**.

#. Enter the amount you want to transfer.

#. Press **Select recipient** to select the recipient of the transfer.

   - You can either choose a recipient that already exists in your Address Book, or add a new one by selecting the **QR** or **+** symbols in the upper right corner.

#. *Optional*: You can add a memo to your transaction. A memo is a short message that will be shown with the transaction. Memos are publicly visible on the chain, so be careful what you write. Adding a memo will also add to the fee of the transaction.

#. Finally, press **Send amount**.

#. Confirm your choices, and press **Yes, send funds**.

Your transaction is now submitted to the chain. It might take a little while for it to finalize on the chain, and you can follow the status of the transaction in the log.

.. Note::
   All transfers will cost a fee. Depending on the type of transaction the amount will differ a bit. All fees are deducted from the **Balance** of the account, also fees for making **Shielded transfers**.
