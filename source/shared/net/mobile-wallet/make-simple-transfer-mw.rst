This topic describes how to make a regular CCD transaction from an account in the Mobile Wallet. If you are looking
for how to make a shielded CCD transfer, you can find the guide :ref:`here <make-shielded-transfer-mw>`.

.. Warning::
   Make sure you have enough funds in your disposable balance to cover transaction fees.

#. In **Paste recipient address** select the recipient of the transfer.

   - You can either choose a recipient that already exists in your **Address Book**, or tap **Scan QR** to add a new one.

#. *Optional*: You can add a memo to your transaction. A memo is a short message that will be shown with the transaction. Memos are publicly visible on the chain, so be careful what you write. Adding a memo will also increase the fee of the transaction.

#. Tap **Send amount**.

Your transaction is now submitted to the chain. It might take a little while for it to finalize on the chain, and you can follow the status of the transaction in the log.

.. Note::
   All transfers and transactions cost a fee. The fee is based on the set NRG for that transaction and the current exchange rate.
   The cost of transaction fees is stable in Euros, and therefore the price in CCD varies depending on the CCD to EUR exchange rate. The fee will always be deducted from the **Balance** of the account, so it is important to have some available CCDs to cover fees.
   You can see the fee in the transaction log.
