The Concordium Mobile wallet is a digital wallet that enables you to create and manage your Concordium
identities and accounts, and to create transactions such as sending GTU, shielding and unshielding GTU,
and sending shielded transactions.


Get started
-----------

#. Install the Mobile Wallet on either an iPhone or an Android phone, see Downloads.

#. Open the Mobile wallet, read and accept the Terms and Conconditions.

#. Create a six-digit passcode. If you would rather use a full password, you can decide to do so as well.

#. Decide whether or not you want to enable biometrics.

Request your identity and initial account
-----------------------------------------

Having set up your passcode and possibly biometrics, you must then submit a request for an identity
and an initial account. This flow will start immediately after setting up for passcode and biometrics.

#. If you don’t have any identities or accounts, select **I want to create my initial account**.

   - If you already have one or more identities and accounts, you can just import them now.

#. Read the next page in the app, shortly explaining the initial account and identity. Press **Okay, got it**!

#. Enter a name for your initial account. This name will only exist locally in the app, and will only be
   known by you. You can choose to call it whatever you like. Press **Continue**.

#. Enter a name for your identity. Again, this name is only stored locally in the app, and you don’t
   have to choose your actual name, it can be whatever you like. Press **Continue to identity providers**.

#. Select a third party identity provider from the list. This will open an external web flow within the app.

#. Finish the flow as presented by the third party identity provider. They will ask you to provide photos
   of identification documents and a selfie.

#. Having finished the external third party flow, you will have a pending initial account and identity in
   your app. The verification or rejection will usually be retrieved from the third party within minutes, but
   please check back in your app frequently for up to seven days, to retrieve the result.

.. Note::
   When your identity and initial account has been verified, we strongly recommend that you make an export.
   This way, you’ll have a backup in case the database is damaged.

.. Note::
   Enter the **Balance** or **Shielded balance** of the new account, by pressing the Balance or Shielded balance
   areas on the account card.
