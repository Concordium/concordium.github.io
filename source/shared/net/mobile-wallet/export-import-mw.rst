Make a backup of identities and accounts in the Mobile Wallet

To make sure that you have a backup of your accounts, identities, and addresses, we strongly recommend that you export the data from the Mobile Wallet to a file. This way, all your accounts, identities, and your address book are saved in a file you can store in a safe location.

.. Warning::
   Currently, it is not possible to exchange identities and accounts between the Mobile Wallet and the Desktop Wallet. If you try to import a file that has been exported from the Mobile Wallet into the Desktop Wallet, the import will fail, and likewise, if you try to import a file exported from the Desktop Wallet into the Mobile Wallet.

Export identities, accounts and address book
============================================

#. Go to the **More** page.

#. Tap **Export**.

#. Enter your biometrics or app passcode.
