Export or import your identities and accounts
=============================================

We recommend that you backup your identities and accounts by exporting them from the Mobile Wallet. By making an export,
all your accounts, identities and your address book will be saved in a file you can store in a safe location.

.. Warning::
   Currently, it is not possible to exchange identities and accounts between the Mobile Wallet and the Desktop Wallet. If
   you try to import a file that has been exported from the Mobile Wallet into the Desktop Wallet, the import will fail, and
   likewise, if you try to import a file exported from the Desktop Wallet into the Mobile Wallet.

Export identities, accounts and address book
============================================

#. Go to the **More** page.

#. Select **Export**.

#. Input your biometrics or app passcode.

#. Read through the explanation of the export and press **Continue**.

#. Choose a password with a minimum of 6 characters, used to encrypt your export. Be sure to choose a safe password and keep it to yourself,
   as this can be used to unlock your export, and in turn be used to make transfers from your account. Press **Continue**.

#. An OS prompt will be shown, letting you choose where to save or send your export. Select an option from the prompt.
