This topic contains an overview of each task you need to complete to set up and start using the Desktop Wallet. The guide assumes that you'll be using the Desktop Wallet in combination with a Ledger Nano S hardware device to generate and store keys and sign transactions.

Step 1: Set up the node
=======================

The Desktop Wallet must be connected to a running node on the Concordium blockchain, so you'll have to run a node. You can run a node using :ref:`Windows<run-node-windows>`, :ref:`macOS <run-node-macos>`, and :ref:`Docker <run-a-node>` or :ref:`Ubuntu <run-node-ubuntu>` for Linux.

Step 2: Set up the Ledger Nano S
================================

The Desktop Wallet requires that you store your keys on a Ledger Nanos S hardware device. This is to ensure that your private account keys are kept secure. To be able to use the Ledger Nano S with the Desktop Wallet, you must install the Concordium Ledger App on the hardware wallet. See :ref:`Install the Ledger App guide<install-ledger-app>`

Step 3: Set up the Concordium Desktop Wallet
============================================

You'll need to install and set up the Desktop Wallet to create and manage identities and accounts and add a baker. See :ref:`Set up the Desktop Wallet<set-up-desktop>`.

Step 4: Set up an identity and an initial account
==================================================

Once you've installed the Desktop Wallet, you must set up an identity and an initial account. We also recommend that you create a separate account to use as a baker account. See :ref:`Create an identity and an initial account in the Desktop Wallet <create-initial-account-desktop>` and :ref:`Create an account in the Desktop Wallet<create-account-desktop>`.

You're now ready to start using the Desktop Wallet.
