In addition, you can see the following information about the selected account:

To make the currently selected account the default account, click the star icon in the lower right corner. Setting this means that this will be the account initially visible when opening the account page.

Address book overview
=====================

The address book is where you can see all addresses of accounts that you've created in or imported into the Desktop Wallet. In addition, you have the option of adding accounts, for example, if you want to send CCD from the desktop wallet to addresses on the mobile wallet.

- When you select a recipient, the recipient's account address is displayed as well as any notes that youâ€™ve added.

The account address could, for example, be an account address that you've copied from the Mobile Wallet or that somebody sent you.

- To find a specific recipient among a long list of recipients, use the search function.

Desktop Wallet settings
=======================

The Desktop Wallet has a number of settings such as password and node settings that you access by going to the **Settings** page.

Preferences
-----------

The Desktop Wallet provides a set of multi-signature transactions called Foundation transactions that only members of the Concordium Foundation can sign.

These transactions are disabled by default, and if you're not a member of the Concordium Foundation we strongly recommend that you don't enable them. If you do enable the transactions, they will be listed on the multi-signature transactions page. However, you'll not be able to actually sign or submit any of these transactions.

Node settings
-------------

Here you specify which node on the blockchain that you want to connect to.

- If you're running the mainnet version of the Desktop Wallet, you must connect to a mainnet node. In the **Address field**, enter ``127.0.0.1`` and in the **Port field** enter ``10000``.

- If you're running the testnet version of the Desktop Wallet, you must connect to a testnet node. In the **Address** field, enter ``127.0.0.1`` and in the **Port field** enter ``10001``.

- Select **Set connection**. If the connection works, there's a message saying **Successfully connected**.

You can run a node using :ref:`Windows<run-node-windows>`, :ref:`macOS <run-node-macos>`, and :ref:`with Docker <run-a-node>` or :ref:`a Debian package <run-node-ubuntu>` on Linux.

Change wallet password
----------------------

On the this page, you can update the existing password for the Desktop Wallet, providing that you remember the current password.

Concordium strongly recommends that you create a backup of your Desktop Wallet database to ensure that you can recover your accounts, identities, and addresses if, for example, you lose the password to the Desktop Wallet. For more information, see :ref:`Make a backup of identities, accounts, and addresses <export-import>`.

Recover existing accounts
-------------------------

If you lose your accounts, you can recover the accounts by using the Ledger device that you used to create the accounts. You only have to perform a recovery if you have lost the backup of your accounts and identities. For more information, see :ref:`Account recovery<account-recovery-desktop>`.

Terms and conditions
--------------------

If you want to view the latest version of the *License notices* and *Terms and conditions for the Desktop Wallet* do the following.

- On Windows, press **Alt** to display the menu bar, and then in the **Help** menu, choose the document you want to view.

- On Linux, press **Alt** to display the menu bar, and then in the **Help** menu, choose the document you want to view.

- On macOS, select **Help** in the menu bar, and then choose the document you want to view.


Make an account report
======================

When you select an account, you can see a list of all transfers in and out of the account. However, if you need a more structured view of the transfers or, for example, want to compare transfers on different accounts, you have the option of creating an account report. The report is saved as a CSV file on your computer, and the CSV format enables you to sort and organize the data in a spreadsheet.

Create a report of transactions on one or more accounts
-------------------------------------------------------

#. Go to **Accounts** and select the account you want to create a report for.

#. Select **Change view**, and then select **Make account report**.

#. Select the time period that you want the report to cover.

#. Select the transaction types that you want to include in the report.

#. If you want to include more accounts in the report, select **Add another account** in the right pane, and then select the relevant account. Repeat this step for each account you want to add to the report.

#. Select **Make account report**. A CSV file with the selected account and types of transactions is generated and stored on your computer. If you have selected multiple accounts, you will get a .zip file containing a .CSV for each account.
