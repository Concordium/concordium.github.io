Make a backup of identities, accounts, and addresses in the Desktop Wallet
==========================================================================

To make sure that you have a backup of your accounts, identities, and addresses, we strongly recommend that you export the data to a file. The backup will ensure that you can recover your accounts, identities, and addresses if your Desktop Wallet database becomes damaged or if, for some reason, you can't access the Desktop Wallet.

.. Warning::
   You are solely responsible for keeping your assets secure. You must never share your private keys, PIN codes, passwords, recovery phrases, Ledgers, or mobile devices with anyone.

Export identities, accounts, and addresses
================================================

#.  Go to **Export/Import**.

#.  Select **Export**.

#.  Create a password that contains at least 6 characters. You'll need the password to import the file into the Desktop Wallet so keep it safe.

#.  Navigate to the location on your computer where you want to save the file. If you're on Windows, make sure that **All Files** is selected in **Save as type**. Give the file a name and the extension .json, and then click **Save**. Once the export is complete, we recommend that you store the file in a safe location.

Import identities, accounts, and addresses
===========================================

#.  Go to **Export/Import**.

#.  Select **Import** and navigate to the location on your computer where you saved the file, and then select **Open**.

#. Enter the password of the import. If the import is successful, you can see all the imported identities, accounts, and addresses in the right pane.

.. Warning::
    You can't import a file created in the Mobile Wallet into the Desktop Wallet or the other way around because the two wallets handle private keys in different ways. For more information, see :ref:`Deciding between the Desktop Wallet and the Mobile Wallet <choosing-wallet>`.`

Recover accounts without a backup file
======================================

If you lose the backup file with your accounts, you can use the Desktop Wallet in combination with your Ledger device to recover those accounts. For more information, see :ref:`Account recovery <account-recovery-desktop>`.
