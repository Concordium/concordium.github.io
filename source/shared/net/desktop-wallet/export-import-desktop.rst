=====================================================
Make a backup of identities, accounts, and addresses
=====================================================

To make sure that you have a backup of your accounts, identities, and addresses, we recommend that you make an export with all the information. The backup will ensure that you can recover your accounts, identities, and addresses if your Desktop Wallet database becomes damaged or if, for some reason, you can't access the Desktop Wallet.

Export identities, accounts, and addresses
=======================================================

#.  Go to **Export/Import**.

#.  Select **Export**.

#.  Create a password that contains at least 6 characters. You'll need the password to import the file into the Desktop Wallet so keep it safe.

#.  Navigate to the location on your computer where you want to save the file. If you're on Windows, make sure that **All Files** is selected in **Save as type**. Give the file a name and the extension .json, and then click **Save**.

Import identities, accounts, and addresses
=======================================================

#.  Go to **Export/Import**.

#.  Select **Import** and navigate to the location on your computer where you saved the file, and then select **Open**.

#. Enter the password of the import. If the import is successful, you can see all the imported identities, accounts, and addresses in the right pane.

.. Warning::
    Currently, it is not possible to exchange identities and accounts between the Mobile Wallet and the Desktop Wallet. If you try to import a file that has been exported from the Mobile Wallet into the Desktop Wallet, the import will fail, and likewise, if you try to import a file exported from the Desktop Wallet into the Mobile Wallet.
