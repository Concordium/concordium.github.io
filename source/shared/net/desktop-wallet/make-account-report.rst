When you select an account, you can see a list of all transfers in and out of the account. However, if you need a more structured view of the transfers or, for example, want to compare transfers on different accounts, you have the option of creating an account report. The report is saved as a CSV file on your computer, and the CSV format enables you to sort and organize the data in a spreadsheet.
