The Desktop Wallet has a number of settings such as password and node settings that you access by going to the **Settings** page.

Multi-signature settings
========================
The Desktop Wallet provides a set of multi-signature transactions called Foundation transactions that only members of the Concordium Foundation can sign.

These transactions are disabled by default, and if you're not a member of the Concordium Foundation we strongly recommend that you don't enable them. If you do enable the transactions, they will be listed on the multi-signature transactions page. However, you'll not be able to sign or submit any of these transactions.

Node settings
=============
Here you specify which node on the blockchain that you want to connect to.

-  Enter the **Address** and **Port** of the node, and then select **Set connection**. If the connection works, there's a message saying **Successfully connected**.

For more information about running a node, see :ref:`run a node on ubuntu <run-node-ubuntu>`.

Change the wallet password
==========================

On the this page, you can update the existing password for the desktop wallet, providing that you remember the current password.

Always create a backup of your Desktop Wallet database to ensure that you can recover your accounts, identities, and addresses if, for example, you lose the password to the Desktop Wallet. For more information, see :ref:`Make a backup of identities, accounts, and addresses <export-import-desktop>`.
