=================================
System requirements to run a node
=================================

The following are the minimum system requirements for running a node. If your system does not meet or exceed these requirements, you might not be able to run the node properly.

You need a broadband connection to run a node, and we strongly recommend that the node is running around the clock. This is especially important if you're running a baker node.

If you use a laptop in combination with Docker, sleep mode can cause problems with the Docker container used to run the node.

System requirements
-------------------

-  CPU: A quad core CPU or better of a new generation x64 (AMD Ryzen™ 5000 series or Intel® Core™ 11000 series desktop or mobile CPUs or CPU with similar single threaded performance).

-  Minimum 16 GB of RAM.

-  Minimum of 1TB fast SSD disk space available (minimum NVMe PCI Express 3.0 4x SSD).

Platforms
---------

You can run a node on :ref:`Ubuntu<ubuntu-node>`, :ref:`Docker<docker-node>`, :ref:`Windows<windows-node>`, or :ref:`MacOS<macos-node>`.
