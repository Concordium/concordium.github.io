The Testnet v1 is the first public release of the Concordium Blockchain. Open
Testnet aims at demonstrating the technology behind the Concordium Blockchain.
This version is not feature-complete compared to the expected features for the
first Mainnet version of the Concordium Blockchain.

Concordium Node version 0.2.4.

Features
--------

This release contains the following main features:

-  Node software in a dockerized container featuring:

   -  *Passive node:* A node that participates in the Concordium
      network. It relays messages, provides an API for submitting
      transactions and inspecting the chain, and processes blocks, but
      does not produce any blocks on its own.
   -  *Baker node:* Does everything a passive node does, but in addition
      participates in consensus, producing blocks.
   -  *Finalizer node:* Does everything a baker node does, but in
      addition participates in the finalization part of our consensus.
   -  *Concordium Client:* A command-line interface to the Concordium
      Blockchain. Can send transactions and inspect the state of the
      node and the chain.
   -  Tools for interacting with the container

-  A demo Web wallet

   -  Creating identities
   -  Creating accounts
   -  Making transfers
   -  Depositing GTU tokens
   -  Exporting identities and accounts

-  A demo Identity service
-  A Network `Dashboard`_

Concordium Nodes
================

Concordium will be running 19 nodes in Europe for this iteration of the Testnet
and an additional node in Hong Kong (all running both baker and finalizer).
