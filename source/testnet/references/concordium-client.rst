The Concordium distribution ships with a CLI tool named
``concordium-client``.

In the current testnet setup, this client requires a `local node`_
(``concordium-node``) to be running. The client will perform its queries
and send transactions through that node.

Due to directory mapping between the Docker container and the host
machine, the tool must be currently invoked from within the following
system-dependent directory:

-  Linux/macOS: ``$HOME/Documents/concordium-software``
-  Windows: {FOLDERID_Documents}\\concordium-software
   (``C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\Documents\\concordium-software`` in a
   standard setup)

**This page will describe the commands that are related with
configuration of the client, but the rest of available commands will be
discussed on the pages where the features that use them are documented.
Some commands will perform**\ `queries`_\ **and others
send**\ `transactions`_\ **.**

Commands and help
-----------------

The commands supported by the tool are divided into two categories: the
high-level and low-level commands. The high-level commands provide a
streamlined and consistent user interface, automatically handling as
much complexity as possible. While most of the common operations are
available via high-level commands, the low-level commands provide a more
direct interface to the node, and some information and capabilities are
not available in high-level commands.

The high-level commands are grouped by topic (``account``, ``baker``,
``config`` etc.). The low-level commands are grouped in the ``raw``
category and have CamelCase names.

Invoke ``concordium-client --help`` to see the full list of topics.
Include the topic to see the available commands within that topic:

::

   $ concordium-client config --help
   Usage: concordium-client config COMMAND
     Commands for inspecting and changing local configuration.

   Available options:
     -h,--help                Show this help text

   Available commands:
     init                     Initialize configuration.
     show                     Show configuration.
     account                  Commands for inspecting and changing account-specific configuration.

Give the full command to see available options related to that command:

::

   $ concordium-client config account import --help
   Usage: concordium-client config account import FILE [--name NAME]
     Import an account to persistent config.

   Available options:
     FILE                     Account file exported from the wallet.
     --name NAME              Name of the account.
     -h,--help                Show this help text
     
     Configuration
-------------

You can store accounts and their keys on disk to avoid having to pass
them as command-line options.

Accounts may also be associated with names which may then be used in
place of the address throughout the client's commands. This is an
entirely local feature for convenience and may be done for any account â€”
it does not require possession of the account's keys.

Each account has

-  one or more (up to 256) key-pairs for signing transactions. They are
   identified by the key index, which is an integer starting at 0.
-  decryption key-pair used for decrypting the shielded balance of the
   account.

For all those keys, the private part of the key-pair is encrypted in the
local storage and a password is required each time the key is needed.
The password is chosen when the keys are either imported via
``config account import`` (see below), or when keys are added to the
account afterwards.

Read more about accounts `here`_.

Location
~~~~~~~~

On the testnet, the configuration directory is mapped by Docker into a
system-dependent directory:

-  Linux/macOS: ``$HOME/.config/concordium``
-  Windows: {FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\\concordium
   (``C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\concordium`` in a
   standard setup)

.. _here: /testnet/docs/managing-accounts

Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command ``concordium-client config init`` initializes the
configuration structure. The distribution does this automatically, so it
should not be necessary to use this command. If the configuration
structure becomes corrupt for some reason, it may also be able to repair
it.

Display contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``concordium-client config show``

Display the full contents of the persistent configuration. This will
display the stored keys that are used for signing transactions (under
the ``Account Keys`` section) and the stored key for sending encrypted
transfers (under the ``Encryption secret key`` section) when they are
present.

Add accounts and keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See also the `Managing accounts`_ section.

Add account
^^^^^^^^^^^

``concordium-client config account add ADDRESS [--name NAME]``

Add account address to persistent configuration, optionally naming the
account.

If a name was provided, this name may now be used to refer to the
account throughout the client.

This doesn't add any private information to the stored account, so it
can be considered as just creating an alias for an address.

Add key to an account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``concordium-client config account add-keys --account ACCOUNT --keys KEYS``

Add a sign/verify key-pair to a specific account. The ``KEYS`` parameter
must be a JSON file that contains the keys that will be added in the
same format as they were shown above when printing the configuration:

::

   {
      idx: {
        "encryptedSignKey": {
          "metadata": {
            "encryptionMethod": "AES-256",
            "iterations": ...,
            "salt": ...,
            "initializationVector": ...,
            "keyDerivationMethod": "PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256"
          },
          "cipherText": ...
        },
        "verifyKey": ...,
        "schemeId": "Ed25519"
      },
      ...
    }

.. _Managing accounts: /testnet/docs/managing-accounts

Import accounts and keys from the Wallet apps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``concordium-client config account import FILE [--name NAME]``

Import the keys of one or more accounts from a JSON file exported from
the `Concordium ID`_ app.

The ``--name`` option selects which account to import and imports it
with this name. If it's omitted, all accounts in the file are imported
under their existing names.

Shell completion
----------------

The ``concordium-client`` has support for generating completion
functions for bash, zsh, and fish.

For bash, the command for installing the completions is:

::

   $ source <(concordium-client --bash-completion-script `which concordium-client`)

Replace ``--bash-completion-script`` by ``--zsh-completion-script`` or
``--fish-completion-script`` for zsh and fish, respectively.

See the documentation of the `framework`_ used to implement the command
structure of ``concordium-client`` for more details.
