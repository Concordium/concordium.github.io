The ```concordium-client```_ tool supports queries of multiple kinds of
state against a backend node:

-  Account state: List all accounts and display all publicly available
   data of a specific account.
-  Transaction status: Show the status of the transaction identified by
   the given transaction hash.
-  Block state: Display a summary of the contents of a specific block
   and its relation to other blocks on the chain.
-  Consensus state: Show the parameters of the consensus protocol and
   statistics related to baking and finalization of blocks.

Account state
-------------

List accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``concordium-client account list [--block BLOCK-HASH]``

List the addresses of all accounts on the chain as of a specific block:

-  ``BLOCK-HASH``: Full hash of the block. Defaults to the current `best
   block`_.

Example
^^^^^^^

::

   $ concordium-client account list

   ...

Inspect specific account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``concordium-client account show [ACCOUNT] [--block BLOCK] [--encrypted] [--decrypt-encrypted]``

Display all publicly available information of a specific account as of a
specific block. For accounts for which secret keys are available this
command can also decrypt the shielded balance.

-  ``ACCOUNT``: Address or local name of the account (if not provided,
   will show the account with the local alias ``"default"``).
-  ``BLOCK``: Full hash of target block. Defaults to the current `best
   block`_.
-  ``--encrypted``: Show the `shielded balance`_ (explained below).
-  ``--decrypt-encrypted``: Show the shielded balance and decrypt it
   (explained below).

.. _best block: /testnet/docs/glossary#best-block
.. _shielded balance: /testnet/docs/glossary#shielded-balance

Example

::

   $ concordium-client account show my-account --encrypted
   Local name:            my-account
   Address:               2zgcMk7heVZKaaBfPtxVqmvE3GnrrP7N2nFGHoiC6X9nZT9TaG
   Amount:                1026.000000 GTU

     - Expiration: Sep 2021
     - Revealed attributes: none

The output shows that the account with the local name ``my-account``

-  has address ``2zgcMk7heVZKaaBfPtxVqmvE3GnrrP7N2nFGHoiC6X9nZT9TaG``,
-  has a balance of 1026 GTU,
-  has `sequence number`_ ``1``, and
-  delegates its stake to the baker with ID 3.
-  has ``a820662531d...`` as the key for receiving encrypted transfers.
-  has no `incoming encrypted amounts`_.
-  has a `self balance`_ of ``a9d35bf62442aabad72c...``. By default this
   only shows the first 20 characters of the encrypted amount. With a
   ``--verbose`` flag the full encryption is shown.

Furthermore, the account's credential reveals no attributes from the
`identity`_ that the account is derived from, and expires at the end of
September 2021.

If the flag ``--decrypt-encrypted`` is provided, each of the encrypted
amounts will be decrypted and the decryption shown. Note that for this
operation to succeed, the private decryption key of the account must be
available in the ``concordium-client`` configuration. The user is asked
for the password for accessing the decryption key.

Transaction status
------------------

``concordium-client transaction status TX-HASH``

Display the lifecycle state of a `transaction`_ (pending, committed,
finalized, or absent).

If the transaction is commited or finalized, the status (success or
rejected) and execution cost is included as well.

Inspect specific block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``concordium-client block show [BLOCK-HASH]``

Display information about a specific block. Note that some fields (e.g.
slot time) are objective (i.e. all nodes participating in the Concordium
network will agree on these) while others (e.g. arrival time) are
specific to the local node:

-  ``BLOCK-HASH``: Full hash of the block. Defaults to the current `best
   block`_.

Inspect consensus parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``concordium-client consensus show-parameters [--include-bakers] [--block BLOCK-HASH]``

Show `election parameters`_ for a specific block, optionally including
bakers and their `lottery power`_:

-  ``BLOCK-HASH``: Full hash of the block. Defaults to the current `best
   block`_.
-  ``--include-bakers``: If set, include table of bakers and their
   lottery power. The lottery power is recomputed periodically, so
   operations that affect them do not take effect immediately. For more
   information about what information will be shown here, see the
   `detailed description on the time constraints`_.
