A *transaction* is an operation which applies some change to the chain.
Transactions always have one sender `account`_ and are signed using the
keys of this account.

There are several transaction types: The most basic one is a GTU
transfer, which moves tokens from the sender account to another account.
Other transaction types include encrypted transfers, `stake
delegation`_, `adding a baker`_, and updating keys of accounts and
bakers.

Every transaction has a well-defined *cost*, the value of which depends
on the transaction type as well as the payload in a way that reflects
the computational effort of applying the transaction as closely as
possible. When the transaction is sumbitted, its cost is deducted from
the sender's account and paid to the network as a fee for carrying out
the transaction. Cost is measured in the unit NRG which corresponds to
GTU according to a variable conversion factor (currently 1 NRG = 0.0001
GTU).

Once a baker receives a transaction from some client, it performs a few
basic checks to verify that the transaction is eligible for *inclusion*
in a `block`_. If any of these checks fail, the transaction is ignored.
Included transactions which satisfy all further requirements are
considered *successful* and have their changes applied to the chain. If
something doesn't check out (for instance, the sender attempted to
overdraw their account), the transaction is still included, but recorded
as *rejected*. A rejected transaction has no effect other than deducting
its cost from the sender.

Each account has a `sequence number`_ associated with it. This number
increases sequentially with each transaction sent from this account and
is recorded into the transaction. Transactions with sequence numbers
that don't match the current one of the account are not considered
eligible for inclusion on the chain. This ensures that transactions are
included only once and in a specific order.

Until some block containing a given transaction is `finalized`_, there
is no guarantee that the transaction is permanent.

Transfers (both plain and encrypted) can be performed using the
`Concordium ID`_ mobile app, or the ```concordium-client```_ tool. All
other transaction types can only be done through ``concordium-client``.

Concordium ID (mobile wallet)
-----------------------------

Once you create `an account`_ in the `wallet`_, the **SEND** button
brings you to the screen for doing transfers from the given account.
Depending on whether you are in the public or shielded balance part of
the account the transfer will be a plain transfer, or an encrypted
transfer.

Command-line tool
-----------------

All types of transactions can be performed using
```concordium-client```_. The different transaction types are performed
using specialized subcommands:

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Command                       | Description                         |

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| ``account undelegate``        | Ensure that an account's stake is   |
|                               | not delegated                       |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+

|                               | account                             |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| ``account remove-keys``       | Remove one or more signing keys     |
|                               | from the account                    |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| ``account encrypt``           | Transfer part of the public balance |
|                               | to shielded balance                 |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| ``account decrypt``           | Transfer part of the shielded       |
|                               | balance to public balance           |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+

Each of these commands have a number of parameters specific to them, but
share a common set of flags and configuration to control how they build
transactions. Depending on the exact context, the flags are currently
all optional:

-  ``--sender``: Name or address of the transaction's sender account.
   The name is the one used when `importing the account`_ (assuming that
   this was done). Defaults to the account name "default".
-  ``--keys``: A number of sign/verify key-pairs associated with the
   account, used to sign the transaction. The format is shown in the
   example below. Should be omitted if the account has been imported.
-  ``--expiration``: Expiration time of the transaction given as a Unix
   epoch or duration string (e.g. ``5m`` for 5 minutes). Defaults to
   ``10m`` (10 minutes).
-  ``--energy``: Maximum amount of NRG to be spent on the transaction.
   With the currently supported transaction types, the default value is
   always the exact amount of energy needed.
-  ``--nonce`` : Sequence number to use for the transaction. This is
   fetched automatically and should only be specified in special cases.

.. _an account: /testnet/docs/identities-and-accounts
.. _wallet: /testnet/docs/quickstart-wallet#before-you-start
.. _``concordium-client``: /testnet/docs/client
.. _importing the account: /testnet/docs/managing-accounts

In most cases, it should be sufficient to provide only the ``--sender``
option and use the account by name.

In all cases, the command will display the exact parameters of the
transaction before sending it, and ask the user to confirm that it
matches their intent. Just before the transaction is sent the user is
asked for the password to access the signing keys.

Once a transaction has been submitted, the command will continuously
poll and display its status until it's been `finalized`_.

The command for transferring GTU is described below. The remaining
commands are used to add, remove, and configure bakers as well as
delegating stake to them. They expose a lower level, but more versatile
set of features compared to the tools described in the quickstart on
`becoming a baker`_. As such, they are considered "advanced" for now and
not further explained. For more information about a command, invoke it
with the ``--help`` flag.

Transfer
~~~~~~~~

A transfer is done using the following command:

::

   concordium-client transaction send-gtu

Apart from the generic transaction flags above, the parameters are:

-  ``--amount``: Number of tokens to send in units of 10-4 GTU.
-  ``--receiver``: Name or address of the receiver account.

.. _finalized: /testnet/docs/glossary#finalization
.. _becoming a baker: /testnet/docs/quickstart-baker

Example: Transferring 25 GTU from one account to another
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Accounts:

-  A: ``4DY7Kq5vXsNDhEAnj969Fd86g9egi1Htq3YmL2qAU9cXWj2a1y``
-  B: ``3EmnjMy8AY5zoebNaA3HuVx1UShdW8vh9n1YjJztmSc2jN4K3V``

If the accounts have both been imported under these names, the command
to transfer 25 GTU is:

::

   concordium-client transaction send-gtu --amount 25 --sender A --receiver B

The output will look similar to the following (in the example we assume
that the sender account A has three transaction signing keys 0, 1, 3).

::

   Sending 25.000000 GTU from '4DY7Kq5vXsNDhEAnj969Fd86g9egi1Htq3YmL2qAU9cXWj2a1y' (A) to '3EmnjMy8AY5zoebNaA3HuVx1UShdW8vh9n1YjJztmSc2jN4K3V' (B).
   Allowing up to 165 NRG to be spent as transaction fee.

   Waiting for the transaction to be committed and finalized.
   You may skip this step by interrupting the command using Ctrl-C (pass flag '--no-wait' to do this by default).
   The transaction will still get processed and may be queried using
     'transaction status 7c484aecbc9dce654956cae1a6f9315679f62afe091d74f865f3602bc8003fbd'.

   [13:05:27] Transaction finalized.
   
   Encrypted transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An encrypted transfer is a transfer from a shielded balance to a
shielded balance of another account. The command is very similar to a
plain transfer

::

   concordium-client transaction send-gtu-encrypted --sender A --receiver B --amount 8

This command will

-  query the chain for the shielded balance of account A from the
   Concordium network
-  decrypt it
-  query the encryption key of account B from the Concordium network
-  and send the transaction.

The interaction looks as follows.

::

   concordium-client transaction send-gtu-encrypted --sender A --receiver B --amount 8                    
   Using default energy amount of 30176 NRG.
   Enter password for decrypting the secret encryption key: ...
   Transferring 8.000000 GTU from encrypted balance of account '4s9jugBpiZuDKNJu9PGAj57JseAze8fGaGJC2y3HmtCbBeTLAJ' (A) to '47JNHkJZo9ShomDypbiSJzdGN7FNxo8MwtUFsPa49KGvejf7Wh' (B).
   Allowing up to 30176 NRG to be spent as transaction fee.
   Transaction expires at Sun,  4 Oct 2020 11:28:47 UTC.
   Confirm [yN]: y
   Enter password for signing key with index 0: ...
   Enter password for signing key with index 1: ...
   Enter password for signing key with index 3: ...
   Transaction 'af220cdeb5c092847de25e4681515d7d318a98223fc4d1dc9c65bda9f2060b19' sent to the baker.
   Waiting for the transaction to be committed and finalized.
   You may skip this step by interrupting the command using Ctrl-C (pass flag '--no-wait' to do this by default).
   The transaction will still get processed and may be queried using
     'transaction status af220cdeb5c092847de25e4681515d7d318a98223fc4d1dc9c65bda9f2060b19'.
   [13:20:24] Waiting for the transaction to be committed..............
   Transaction is finalized into block 552c32da51ca67a6579c1c151ee67440ade5a44f9ca69e13a4a042e7fcc1ee4c with status "success" and cost 3.012300 GTU (30123 NRG).
   [13:20:46] Waiting for the transaction to be finalized...
   [13:20:46] Transaction finalized.
   
   This command has all of the additional options of ``send-gtu``, as well
as an additional flag ``--index.`` This flag, if given, is used to
select which `incoming encrypted amounts`_ that will be used as input to
the transaction. This is best illustrated on an example. `Querying an
account`_ can display the list of incoming amounts on account. An output
could look as follows

::

   ...
   Encrypted balance:
     Incoming amounts:
       7: 8c0faff6739bffc531c5...
       8: a7620250f8b4307565a8...
       9: a67a39e44765e90987c4...
     Self balance: c0000000000000000000...
   ...

If we were to ``send-gtu-encrypted`` from the account while supplying
index 8, only the encrypted amount ``8c0faff6739bffc531c5...`` and the
`self balance`_ would be used as input of the encrypted transfer.

If the supplied index is out of range ``concordium-client`` will refuse
to send the transaction.

.. _Querying an account: /testnet/docs/queries#account-state
.. _self balance: /testnet/docs/glossary#self-balance

Shield an amount
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command to shield an amount with ``concordium-client`` is
``account encrypt``. For example, an interaction to shield 10 GTU on
account A looks as follows.

The command is

::

   concordium-client account encrypt --amount 10 --sender A

It supports all of the same additional flags as the transfer
transaction, apart from the ``--receiver`` since transfer from public to
encrypted balance is always on the same account. The output looks as
follows

::

   Using default energy amount of 265 NRG.
   Transferring 10.000000 GTU from public to encrypted balance of account '4s9jugBpiZuDKNJu9PGAj57JseAze8fGaGJC2y3HmtCbBeTLAJ' (A).
   Allowing up to 265 NRG to be spent as transaction fee.
   Transaction expires at Sun,  4 Oct 2020 11:25:02 UTC.
   Confirm [yN]: y
   Enter password for signing key with index 0: ...
   Enter password for signing key with index 1: ...
   Enter password for signing key with index 3: ...

   Waiting for the transaction to be committed and finalized.
   You may skip this step by interrupting the command using Ctrl-C (pass flag '--no-wait' to do this by default).
   The transaction will still get processed and may be queried using
     'transaction status 9a74be8f99e26dfa0c269725205fb63d447c357ea61b8e6e4df8230059ba22f5'.
   [13:15:10] Waiting for the transaction to be committed.....
   Transaction is finalized into block c12e7772190d1361dc7d59a1cc873906436742e726d12213cb599eb48b97bd2c with status "success" and cost 0.021200 GTU (212 NRG).
   [13:15:14] Waiting for the transaction to be finalized...
   [13:15:14] Transaction finalized.
   
   Unshield an amount
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command to unshield an amount with ``concordium-client`` is
``account decrypt``. For example, an interaction to unshield 7 GTU on
account B looks as follows.

The command is

::

   concordium-client account decrypt --sender B --amount 7

This will

-  query the state of account B from the Concordium network
-  decrypt the shielded balance and check that it is sufficient
-  send the transaction

This supports the same optional flags as ``encrypt``, with the addition
of ``--index`` which has the same meaning as in the
``send-gtu-encrypted`` command.

::

   Using default energy amount of 16171 NRG.
   Enter password for decrypting the secret encryption key: 
   Transferring 7.000000 GTU from encrypted to public balance of account '47JNHkJZo9ShomDypbiSJzdGN7FNxo8MwtUFsPa49KGvejf7Wh' (B).
   Allowing up to 16171 NRG to be spent as transaction fee.
   Transaction expires at Sun,  4 Oct 2020 11:44:07 UTC.
   Confirm [yN]: y
   Enter password for signing key with index 0: ...
   Enter password for signing key with index 1: ...

   Waiting for the transaction to be committed and finalized.
   You may skip this step by interrupting the command using Ctrl-C (pass flag '--no-wait' to do this by default).
   The transaction will still get processed and may be queried using
     'transaction status b240ed919767b89a03984e71a0c39cff52f3374ab2b1721e489c02dc3fb1e691'.
