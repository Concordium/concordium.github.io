Identities and accounts

-  `Creating an account`_
-  `Benefits`_
-  `Revoking anonymity`_

In order to be an active participant on the Concordium blockchain (e.g.,
hold, send, receive `GTU`_) a user must create an *account*.

To facilitate compliance with relevant regulations, an account can only
be created from an *identity* which is issued `off-chain`_ by an
Identity provider. While an account has to be created from an identity,
the user's privacy is still protected, and the account owner's identity
can only be revealed via the process of *anonymity revocation*, which
can only happen under stringent regulations, such as upon a court order.
In particular, a key feature of the design of identities and accounts is
that the identity provider cannot reveal the identity of an account on
their own.

Anonymity revocation can only happen in exceptional circumstances (e.g.,
if authorities have detected suspicious activity on the account) and
requires action by one or more anonymity revokers and the identity
provider who issued the account's identity.

Obtaining an identity
---------------------

Identities are issued by an identity provider. There is a registry of
approved identity providers publicly accessible from the Concordium
blockchain, with their contact information. Concordium Foundation will
maintain the list in the beginning.

Each identity contains a number of cryptographic values, and a number of
user-chosen attributes, such as nationality or country of residence.
These attributes are certified by the identity provider. The
cryptographic values are a number of public and private keys, a
signature from the identity provider, as well as a number of secret
values the user must use to be able to use the identity to create
accounts.

Identities can be created via the mobile `wallet`_. Identity issuance
requires *Identity Verification*, which is the process of verifying the
real-life identity of the user. This will typically involve taking
photographs, scans of identification documents (e.g., passport), etc.
Identity verification also checks that the user-chosen attributes are
valid for the user.

Concordium ID (mobile wallet) identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the testnet phase the `Concordium ID`_ app supports two identity
issuance flows: *Notabene* and *Notabene (development)*. In both cases
the identity provider is `Notabene`_, but the identity verifiers differ.

The *Notabene* flow is supported by `Onfido`_ and requires the user to
take photos of themselves, as well as supporting documentation such as a
passport, driver's license or identity card. The identity attributes are
determined based on the provided documentation.

The *Notabene (development)* flow allows the user to provide their own
attributes and does no verification. This flow is available for testing
purposes, and will not be supported on the `mainnet`_.

Creating an account
-------------------

Once a user has an identity, they can use it to create a number of
accounts. In contrast to obtaining an identity, opening an account is an
`on-chain`_ action and requires sending a transaction to a node
participating in the Concordium network. The input to the transaction is
a *credential* which contains a number of cryptographic proofs, as well
as a selection of attributes the user wishes to reveal publicly. The
proofs establish that the attributes the user revealed publicly are the
ones approved by the identity provider. The proofs reveal no other
information. In particular, the identity provider itself cannot
determine the owner of the account. (Revealing the owner is only
possible through `anonymity revocation`_, which requires the identity
provider and anonymity revokers to act together.) Note that revealing
attributes publicly is completely optional. The benefit gained from
revealing attributes is that other users may decide whether to trust the
account based on the publicly available information.

Benefits
--------

Every account on the chain must be derived from an identity that is
verified and signed by an approved identity provider. It is publicly
visible which identity provider issued an identity for an account, and
who the anonymity revokers are for the account and the identity. In
addition to this basic information which enables regulatory compliance,
an account owner can choose to publicly reveal other values on their
account, such as their nationality or country of residence. Since this
information is publicly accessible anybody can check it before
interacting with an account. Moreover, being able to see who issued the
identity enables whoever wishes to interact with an account to judge the
level of risk in the transaction.

Revoking anonymity
------------------

When necessary, the anonymity revokers and identity provider can work
together to determine the owner of an account and determine which
accounts belong to the same owner. (They should only do so when legally
obliged to, such as by a court order.) Anonymity revocation is a
two-stage process requiring cooperation of multiple parties.

1. Each account has an encryption of a specific *user identifier*. This
   number can be decrypted by sufficiently many of the anonymity
   revokers working together. (The set of anonymity revokers and the
   number of them required to decrypt the user identifier are determined
   when the identity is issued.)
2. Once the user identifier is decrypted the identity provider can look
   up the real-life identity of the owner of the account.

After step 2 the anonymity revokers can additionally decrypt a value
that is held by the identity provider and allows the revokers to find
all accounts the user has created from a given identity. Additionally,
this value allows anonymity revokers to see the amount of GTUs in the
shielded balance of de-anonymized accounts.

All of these actions are subject to rules and processes, and only the
relevant entities learn any information about the account owner. No
information is publicly revealed.
