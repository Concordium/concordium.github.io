-  `The mobile wallet: Concordium ID`_
-  `Command-line tool`_
-  `Node Dashboard`_
-  `Account sequence number`_

An account on the Concordium blockchain consists of two parts. The
`on-chain`_ part which is publicly visible, and maintained by the
bakers, and the `off-chain`_ part which contains

-  private keys of the account which are used to sign actions by the
   account (e.g., sending transfers, deploying smart contracts)
-  the identity an account is created from. This is needed for managing
   the account on the chain, e.g., renewing it.
-  decryption keys used for `shielded transfers`_.

Concordium provides several ways of interacting with the on-chain
account. Off-chain parts of accounts can be transferred between
different devices, and the same account can be used from multiple
devices at the same time.

Accounts on the chain are identified via an account address, which is a
32-byte sequence. The address is usually displayed in Base58Check
encoding with version byte 1. An example of such an address is
``3ZFGxLtnUUSJGW2WqjMh1DDjxyq5rnytCwkSqxFTpsWSFdQnNn``.

In the tools described below the user will typically select an **account
name** which makes the account easier to identify. It is important to
note that an account name is a purely local concept and is not used by
the Concordium blockchain.

The mobile wallet: Concordium ID
--------------------------------

`Concordium ID`_ is a smartphone app that allows creation of accounts
from identities issued by the external identity provider `Notabene`_, as
well as transfers of GTU from created accounts.

This app can export identities and accounts that the user created.

Command-line tool
-----------------

The Concordium distribution ships with a command-line tool named
```concordium-client```_. It is designed as a low-level interface to the
Concordium blockchain. It cannot be used to create identities, but it
can `import`_ accounts exported from the mobile wallets. Once an account
has been imported, the tool can be used to do GTU transfers from the
account, as well as send all other `transaction`_ types supported by the
Concordium blockchain.

Node Dashboard
--------------

The node dashboard can import accounts from the files exported from the
wallet. The dashboard only uses the account to register the node as a
baker.

The node dashboard shares configuration with ``concordium-client``, so
once an account has been imported into one of the applications, it is
also available in the other.

Account sequence number
-----------------------

Each account on the Concordium blockchain has a sequence number and each
transaction signed by the account must have a sequence number. For a
transaction to be considered valid its sequence number must be the next
available one for the account. The sequence number is maintained by all
the bakers in order to validate transactions.

The sequence number can be looked up from an up to date node by running

::

   concordium-client account show [ACCOUNT]

where ``[ACCOUNT]`` is an optional argument that is either an address of
an account or the name of an account chosen when importing the account.
If no address is provided, ``concordium-client`` will use the account
name ``default``.

The mobile wallets and the node dashboard automatically keep track of
the sequence number and assign the correct one when sending
transactions. ``concordium-client`` also tracks the sequence number
automatically, but it can also be set manually via the option
``--nonce``.
