.. _transaction-fees:

.. Note::
   All transactions and transactions cost a fee, including shielding and unshielding transactions. The fee is based on the set NRG for that transaction and the current exchange rate. 
   The cost of transaction fees is stable in Euros, and therefore the price in CCD varies depending on the CCD to EUR exchange rate. The fee will always be deducted from the **Balance** of the account, so it is important to have some available CCDs to cover fees. 
   You can see the fee in the transaction log.
