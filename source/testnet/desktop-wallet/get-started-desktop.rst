====================================
Get started with the Desktop Wallet
====================================

The Concordium Desktop Wallet is a digital wallet that enables you to create and manage your Concordium identities, credentials, and accounts, and to create transactions such as sending GTU, adding a baker, and exporting and importing account information.

The Desktop Wallet also supports storing of your private keys on a hardware wallet. Currently, only the Ledger Nano S is supported.

Prerequisites
=============

-  :ref:`Run a node <run-node-ubuntu>` on the Concordium blockchain. The node enables the Desktop Wallet to interact with the Concordium blockchain to receive updates and post transaction.

-  Set up a :ref:`Ledger Nano S hardware wallet and install the Concordium Ledger App <install-Ledger-app>`.

Set up the Desktop Wallet
=========================

#. Install the Desktop Wallet. For more information, see :ref:`Installation downloads <downloads>`.

#. Open the Desktop Wallet and create a password that contains at least 6 characters. Keep the password safe. Youâ€™ll need it to sign into the Desktop Wallet again.

1. In the Desktop Wallet go to **Settings**, select **Multi signature settings**, and then select **Node settings**.

#. Enter the **Address** and **Port** of the node you're running. The address is the network address of the node.

#. Select **Set connection**. If the connection is working properly, there's a message saying **Successfully connected**.

The next step is to :ref:`set up an initial account and an identity <create-initial-account-desktop>`.

.. Note::
    Currently, it is not possible to exchange identities and accounts between the Mobile Wallet and the Desktop Wallet. If you try to import a file that has been exported from the Mobile Wallet into the Desktop Wallet, the import will fail, and likewise, if you try to import a file exported from the Desktop Wallet into the Mobile Wallet.
