Issue with adding a baker on node dashboard on Mac in previous Mac release
==========================================================================

There was an issue on Mac when trying to add a baker on the node
dashboard, which failed with a network error in the first released Mac
version. We have fixed the issue and uploaded a new release for Mac to
our https://developers.concordium.com/testnet/docs/downloads page.
Please make sure to download the latest Mac version, released on
2020-10-16, stop your node, reset your data, and restart your node.

If you have a previous release version, please complete the following
steps:

-  Delete folder ``~/Documents/concordium-software``.
-  Extract the new release .zip into folder ``~/Documents``.
-  Open a terminal in ``~/Documents/concordium-software`` and run
   ``./concordium-node-stop``.
-  Reset the data by running ``./concordium-node-reset-data``.
-  Run ``./concordium-node`` and let it catch up.

Note that in all releases you can use the Concordium client for account
and baker management, see e.g.
``concordium-client config account --help`` and
``concordium-client baker --help``, respectively, to get started.

Multiple nodes, bakers, and accounts
------------------------------------

We do not currently support running two nodes on the same machine. This
means that while it is possible, we provide no support for it. When the
``concordium-node`` tool is run when the node is already running it will
either do nothing, in case none of the parameters, e.g., node name, have
changed, or restart the node with the new parameters. Note that "do
nothing" means that it will attach the terminal to the existing running
node, so it will appear similar to if another node is running, but upon
close inspection it will become clear that the outputs of the previously
running, and the "newly started" nodes are the same.

A node can only run as one baker. A baker is by definition a member of
the committee. The current committee can be obtained by querying the
node via
``concordium-client consensus show-parameters --include-bakers``. A node
can run as a baker or not, depending on how it is started, and whether
the keys it starts with are registered in the committee.

Which baker the node runs as is determined by the baker keys that it
starts with (these are in the file ``baker-credentials.json``). If a
node is restarted it reloads the keys that exist at the time it starts.

The same account can be used to register multiple bakers. All these
bakers will, by default, have the account as the reward account. An
account can only delegate to one of the bakers however (delegate in the
sense that the tokens on the account will count towards the stake of the
baker). When a baker is registered, and without further action, it will
be in the committee, but it will have 0% stake. Any account can
subsequently delegate to any of the registered bakers.

Appearance of high memory consumption of the node
-------------------------------------------------

The Concordium node may appear to use a lot of memory, and its memory
consumption may grow over time. This happens because the node internally
uses the LMDB database for block and transaction storage. LMDB manages
the database as a single memory-mapped file which can cause certain
tools to erroneously include the whole or parts of the database file
into the reported memory consumption of the process.

Symbolic links in ``Documents`` path
------------------------------------

On Linux and macOS the ``concordium-client`` tool must be run from
``$HOME/Documents/concordium-software`` directory or its subdirectory.

The tool checks the absolute path of the directory and any symbolic
links in the path will make this check fail.

For example if ``$HOME/Documents`` is a symbolic link to some other
directory then the tool will fail to start.

The easiest way to check the absolute path is to run ``pwd -P``.

Node does not catch up with chain on Windows
--------------------------------------------

On Windows, the Concordium node may fail to catch up with the chain when
changing internet connections. It usually catches up with the chain
again after few minutes. Otherwise, stop and restart the node.

Failure to catch-up on Windows might also occur, if the time in the
docker virtual machine is out of sync. This can happen as a result of
the machine entering sleep (even if the node is not running at the
time). The following may be indications that this has occurred:

-  Errors in the log such as
   ``ERROR: External: Error importing block: ResultEarlyBlock`` (or any
   other error involving ``ResultEarlyBlock``).
-  Timestamps of messages in the log do not match the system time.
   (Note, the log timestamps are given in the UTC timezone; you may need
   to add or subtract a few hours to convert to your local time.)

To fix this, shutdown the node, restart your computer (or just restart
Docker Desktop), and then restart the node.

If the problem persists, it could be that the system time is set
incorrectly. (This is especially likely if you observe negative times on
the Concordium Network Dashboard.) To fix this, open *Date & time
settings* and select *Sync now* under *Synchronize your clock*. You may
have to restart the node as described above after synchronizing your
clock.

(Note: it may be possible to resynchronize the virtual machine's clock
without having to restart it. This can be done by stopping and
restarting the *Time synchronization* integration service for the docker
virtual machine using *Hyper-V Manager*.)

Docker error port already in use
--------------------------------

The node may fail starting with the error
``Error starting {..} proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:{PORT}: bind: address already in use``,
which can be remedied by using a different ``{PORT}`` than the default
used by the node.

The ports used by the node are as follows:

-  8888, the port for P2P networking, which can be set with
   ``--listen-node-port``
-  8099, the port used by the node dashboard, which can be set with
   ``--listen-dashboard-port``
-  8082, the port used by internal backend, which can be set with
   ``--listen-middleware-port``
-  10000, the gRPC port, which can be set with ``--listen-grpc-port``

When changing the mappings above the docker container must be stopped,
reset, and started again. To reset the container either use
``concordiumn-node-reset-data`` or run ``docker rm concordium-client``
in a terminal.

Supported ID document types and countries
-----------------------------------------

For issuing a real-world identity in the mobile wallet
``Concordium ID``, i.e. an identity based on a physical ID document, 3rd
parties identity issuer Notabene and identity verifier Onfido are
invoked. For a list of supported ID document types and countries, please
visit `supported ID documents`_.

The previously described identity issuing option can be selected in the
process of creating a new identity using ``Notabene`` on the New
Identity Verification screen. Note that with option
``Notabene development`` test identities can be issued, which are not
verified against physical ID documents.

Inconsistency with Spanish national identity card
-------------------------------------------------

A Spanish national identity card shows the serial number of the card
(NUM SOPORT) and the identity number of the holder (DNI). When issuing a
real-world identity in the mobile wallet ``Concordium ID``, based on a
Spanish national identity card, NUM SOPORT should be included in the
issued identity. Inconsistencies may be observed where DNI is used
instead. This issue is caused on the side of the 3rd party issue
verifier Onfido.

Performance issues in mobile wallet on Android phones
-----------------------------------------------------

Performance issues, e.g. long processing times, might occur when running
the mobile wallet ``Concordium ID`` on a low end Android phone.
Processing delays might not be indicated by approriate waiting screens.

Robustness issues with shielded transfer in mobile wallets
----------------------------------------------------------

When executing multiple shielded transfers or unshielding flows in the
mobile wallets within a very short period of time, inconsistencies might
be observed. Those robustness issues can be circumvented by waiting a
few seconds between such transactions.

Creation of account fails with imported identity
------------------------------------------------

Creating a new account with an imported identity fails in the following
scenario:

-  create an identity
-  make an export
-  create accounts using the identity
-  reinstall the app
-  import the exportfile
-  create an account, using the imported identity.

Node dashboard shows outdated information after node reset
----------------------------------------------------------

The node dashboard stores information about the baking status and
pending transactions. This state is stored in the browser and is not
cleared with the node reset. To clear the information, use the following
keys while being on the node dashboard:

-  Windows/Linux: ctrl + delete
-  MacOS: ctrl + fn + backspace Once pressed, you will be prompted to
   confirm the action.

You can also delete the entries in the browser's local storage manually
and immediately refresh the webpage before it re-inserts the entries
again.

Node dashboard does not load
----------------------------

When connecting to the node dashboard from a machine other than the one
running the node, the node dashboard may not load, showing the error
"Oops, something went wrong: HTTP Network error". Accessing the node
dashboard remotely is not supported, but may be achieved in one of the
following ways.

SSH tunnel to the node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the node is running on a server to which you have SSH access, you can
forward ports on your local machine to ports on the server via an SSH
tunnel. To access the node dashboard, it is necessary to forward both
the node dashboard server port (8099 by default) and the middleware port
(8082 by default). For example:

::

   ssh -L 8099:0.0.0.0:8099 -L 8082:0.0.0.0:8082 user@server

It should then be possible to access the node dashboard at
http://localhost:8099/.

Configure the middleware address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The node dashboard by default attempts to connect to the middleware
server at ``127.0.0.1`` (the local machine). It is possible to configure
this when starting the node by providing the command-line argument
``--listen-middleware-address <node address>``, where ``<node address>``
is the address that you will use to connect to the node. (To change
this, the node must be `stopped`_, reset, and started again. To reset
the node use ``concordium-node-reset-data`` in a terminal.)

Note that it is *strongly recommended* to configure your firewall so
that access to ports other than 8888 (peer-to-peer networking) is not
possible from the public internet. Someone with access to the `other
ports`_ may be able to take control of your node or accounts you have
saved on the node.
