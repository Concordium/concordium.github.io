Glossary of Concordium Terms
============================

See also our `whitepaper`_ for more details on the terms described
below.

Account
~~~~~~~

An addressable store of funds on the blockchain. An account is
associated with one or more *account keys* that can be used to authorize
transactions originating from the account, as well as with an
`encryption key`_ that can be used to send encrypted transfers to the
account. An account is also associated with the account holder's
`identity`_, although this association is encrypted for anonymity. This
anonymity can only be revoked by anonymity revokers, in cooperation with
the account's `identity provider`_.

Attribute
~~~~~~~~~

User data, such as date of birth or country of residence, that is
associated with a user `identity`_. Users can choose which attributes
should be revealed in each of their accounts.

Baker
~~~~~

A node that participates in the production of `blocks`_, referred to as
*baking*.

Best block
~~~~~~~~~~

Last block on the `best chain`_.

.. _identity: #identity
.. _identity provider: #identity-provider
.. _blocks: #block
.. _best chain: #best-chain

Best chain
~~~~~~~~~~

The chain a `baker`_ will build upon when making a new block. The best
chain selection procedure is determined by the consensus protocol. In
particular, the best chain has the most `finalized`_ blocks, and the
most blocks after the last finalized block.

Block
~~~~~

The basic unit of the blockchain, which is produced by a `baker`_. A
block contains a (possibly empty) list of `transactions`_, and has a
pointer to a previous block (with the exception of the `genesis
block`_). A block and its predecessors form a chain, and the sequence of
transactions they contain form a ledger. Each block has a `slot time`_
that records when it was baked. A block also contains information
relating to consensus, for instance establishing which baker created the
block, and that the baker was entitled to do so.

Catch-up
~~~~~~~~

The mechanism by which a node receive messages that may have been
missed, for instance because the node was offline when it was sent.

Chain
~~~~~

A sequence of `blocks`_, starting from the `genesis block`_, in which
each successive block points to the predecessor. There may be multiple
valid chains, and the `consensus`_ protocol establishes which chain is
authoritative.

Consensus
~~~~~~~~~

The process by which nodes agree which `transactions`_ have occurred and
in what order. This consists of `baking`_ and `finalization`_.

Decryption key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dual to `encryption-key`_. In contrast to the encryption key, which is
public, this key is only known to the account holder.

Encrypted amount
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An amount of `GTU`_ that is encrypted with the public key of an account.
Only the owner of the secret key can determine how many GTUs are
contained in the encryption.

Encryption key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An `ElGamal`_ public key associated to an account which is used to
encrypt all `encrypted amounts`_ on the account.

Epoch
~~~~~

A time period consisting of multiple `slots`_ (on the testnet, an epoch
lasts for approximately one hour). At the start of each epoch, we
compute a `leadership election nonce`_ based on the block nonces of the
previous epoch. The leadership election nonce is valid for the duration
of the epoch.

Finalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process by which a block is marked to be "finalized", i.e. part of
the authoritative `chain`_. Transactions that are part of finalized
blocks are considered authoritative. New blocks can be only added
following the last finalized block. The finalization process is
conducted periodically by the bakers with `delegated stake`_ at least
0.1% of the total stake in the system.

Genesis Block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first `block`_ in a `chain`_. The genesis block establishes the
starting state of the chain, before any transactions have occurred.

Global Transaction Unit (GTU)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The currency of the Concordium blockchain. GTU can be used for multiple
purposes:

-  as a form of payment between users via transactions,
-  as a payment for executing smart contracts,
-  as a store of value,
-  as a reward for honest behaviour (e.g. `baking`_ or `finalizing`_
   blocks on top of the longest chain), to incentivize blockchain users.

The smallest subdivision of GTU is the µGTU (micro GTU), with 1 GTU =
1,000,000 µGTU. This means that GTU amounts are given with up to six
decimal places of precision.

Identity
~~~~~~~~

Before opening an account on the Concordium Platform, one's real-world
identity must be verified and recorded by an `identity provider`_. A
user’s identity is anonymous on-chain, however this anonymity can be
revoked and their real-world identity revealed in response to a valid
request from a government authority.

Identity Issuer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See `identity provider`_.

Identity Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A person or organization that performs off-chain identification of
users. Users are required to obtain an identity object from an identity
provider in order to open an account on the Concordium Platform.

Leader Election
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check whether a given `baker`_ has won in a given `slot`_, the baker
uses the slot number and the *leadership election nonce* to compute a
value *r*. The leadership election nonce is a random value that is
periodically updated to prevent parties from predicting too far into the
future when they will win. A baker wins if the value *r* is below a
certain threshold, which depends on the baker’s `lottery power`_ and a
common difficulty parameter *f*. The `winning probability`_ is roughly
proportional to the baker's stake, and higher difficulty parameters
decrease the winning probability for all parties.

Lottery Power
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A baker's lottery power is its relative stake and is therefore
proportional to the `stake`_ that is delegated to it. The lottery power
is updated each `epoch`_, and is based on the stake distribution at the
end of the epoch before last. (This delay ensures that the stake
distribution is determined before the randomness that fixes the bakers
for the epoch: otherwise, stakeholders might redistribute their stake to
luckier bakers, which undermines the security of the system.)

Mainnet
~~~~~~~

The main Concordium network which is expected to launch in early 2021.
The mainnet will receive periodic upgrades, but in contrast to the
`testnet`_, it will never be reset, and accounts created on the mainnet
will remain indefinitely.

Node
~~~~

A participant in the Concordium network. Nodes receive blocks and
transactions, and track the current state of the blockchain. A `baker
node`_ has cryptographic keys that enable it to take part in baking and
`finalization`_. A node without these keys is referred to as a *passive
node*.

Nonce
~~~~~

May refer to:

-  *Block Nonce*: a randomized value included by the `baker`_ in each
   `block`_, and used to determine the leadership election nonce.
-  *Leadership Election Nonce*: a randomized value that is updated each
   `epoch`_ that is used to seed the `leader election`_ process.
-  `Transaction sequence number`_ (same as account sequence number)

Off-chain
~~~~~~~~~

Refers to activities outside of the Concordium blockchain. Some on-chain
actions need preliminary actions off-chain, for example to create an
account on the Concordium blockchain the user must first work with an
identity provider, e.g., via their website or mobile application, to
obtain a specific digital certificate. We refer to this certificate as
the **identity**.

On-chain
~~~~~~~~

Refers to an an event or activity that is propagated through the
Concordium network and recorded on the Concordium blockchain. The
recording can be explicit or implicit as part of the consensus protocol.
An example of the former is a transaction such as a GTU transfer, an
example of the latter are the rewards given out to, e.g., bakers.

Shielded balance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The part of the balance of an `account`_ that only the owner of the
account can see. This is achieved by encrypting transfers to an account
with the account's `encryption key`_. Every participant of the
Concordium network can see the `ciphertexts`_ of all the transfers,
however they provide no information on how many GTUs were transferred.
The receiver of the transfer can use their secret key to decrypt the
ciphertexts, and seeing how many GTUs they have received.

For technical reasons the shielded balance of the account consists of
two parts, the "self balance" and the "incoming encrypted amounts".

Self balance
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a single encrypted amount that is updated each time the account
performs and encrypted transfer, `shielding`_, or `unshielding`_. Only
the account itself can update this value.

Incoming encrypted amount
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a list of encrypted amounts that is extended each time an
account receives an encrypted transfer. When the account makes an
encrypted transfer it can use a number of encrypted amounts from this
list as inputs to the transfer.

.. _account: #account
.. _encryption key: #encryption-key
.. _ciphertexts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext
.. _shielding: #shielding
.. _unshielding: #unshielding

Shielding
~~~~~~~~~

The action of transferring a part of the public balance to the `shielded
balance`_.

Slot
~~~~

In the blockchain, time is divided into equally sized units called
*slots*. On the testnet the duration of slot is one second. In every
slot, each baker checks locally whether they won the lottery, which
entitles the winner to bake a block in that slot. Zero, one, or multiple
bakers can win the lottery. The probability of these different events is
controlled by the difficulty parameter *f*. For example, with difficulty
0.5 on average every second slot will have a lottery winner.

Stake Delegation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The association between `accounts`_ and `bakers`_ that determines the
stake associated with a baker, and hence its relative power in the
`consensus mechanisms`_. Each account may delegate its stake to any
baker, and the stake of a baker is the sum of the funds of the accounts
that delegate to it. This delegation confers power to the baker, and
therefore an account holder should trust the delegate baker to act
honestly. Delegating the stake does not affect that account holder's
ability to use the funds on the account, and does not give the baker
control over the account.

Testnet
~~~~~~~

A test network run by Concordium to test its protocols and software.
There can be several test networks in existence at the same time. All
the features are tested on the testnet before they are released on the
`mainnet`_.

Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~

An atomic operation that defines a change of state in the ledger, such
as transferring funds from one account to another. A transaction
typically has a sender account and a `transaction sequence number`_, and
incurs a fee. The sender account must sign the transaction to authorize
it. (The exception to this is a credential deployment transaction that
creates a new account, which does not have a sender account.)

Transaction Sequence Number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sequence number that orders `transactions`_ on a given `account`_. In
a ledger, all transactions for an account must be ordered with
consecutive transaction sequence numbers, starting from 1. Transaction
sequence numbers ensure that a transaction cannot be repeated in the
ledger, and that the transactions occur in the order intended by the
sender account holder.

Unshielding
~~~~~~~~~~~

The action of transferring a part of the `shielded balance`_ to the
public balance.

Winning probability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The winning probability is the probability that a baker wins in a given
slot. The probability is *1-(1-f)α*, where *f* is the difficulty
parameter and *α* is the `lottery power`_.
